1
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:17,117
Well, my dad was a farmer.

2
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:20,745
Like everybody else back then.

3
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:25,041
Of course, he didn't start that way.

4
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:33,025
Computer says you're too tight.

5
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,969
- Nah, I got this.
- Crossing the Straights.

6
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:40,140
- Shutting it down, Cooper.
- No!

7
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,060
- Shutting it all down.
- No, I need power up!

8
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:49,441
Dad?

9
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:58,625
Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.

10
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:01,327
- I thought you were the ghost.
- No.

11
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:04,965
There are no such things
as ghosts, babe.

12
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:07,333
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

13
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:13,606
Maybe that's because Grandpa's a little
too close to being one himself. Back to bed.

14
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,675
Were you dreaming about the crash?

15
00:02:16,993 --> 00:02:19,387
Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh.

16
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:47,916
The wheat had died.

17
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,085
The blight came and we had to burn it.

18
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:54,681
And we still had corn.
We had acres of corn.

19
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:57,133
But... mostly we had dust.

20
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:02,147
I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

21
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:06,226
Just that steady blow of dirt.

22
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:11,364
We wore... little strips of sheet...

23
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:14,242
sometimes over our nose and mouth...

24
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:16,945
so that we wouldn't breathe
so much of it.

25
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:22,234
Well, when we set the table,
we always set the plate upside-down.

26
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:25,578
Glasses or cups,
whatever it was upside-down.

27
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,019
Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!

28
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:36,848
Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,
Herbicide Resistance 101.

29
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:38,550
- Check?
- Yes, sir.

30
00:03:39,993 --> 00:03:41,761
Not at the table, Murph.

31
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:44,347
Dad, can you fix this?

32
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:48,468
- What the heck did you do to my lander?
- Wasn't me.

33
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:50,612
Let me guess. It was your ghost?

34
00:03:50,712 --> 00:03:53,114
It knocked it off.
It keeps knocking books off.

35
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:55,039
- No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.
- Hey.

36
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:58,395
- I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.
- Dad, tell her.

37
00:03:58,495 --> 00:04:00,580
Well, it's not very scientific, Murph.

38
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,083
You said science was about admitting
what we don't know.

39
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:07,120
- She's got you there.
- Hey. Start looking after our stuff.

40
00:04:08,646 --> 00:04:09,956
Coop.

41
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,919
All right, Murph,
you want to talk science?

42
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:19,099
Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.
No, you got to go further.

43
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,035
You got to record the facts, analyze,
get to the how and the why...

44
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:25,555
then present your conclusions. Deal?

45
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:27,640
- Deal.
- All right.

46
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:32,645
- Have a good day at school.
- Hold up.

47
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,367
Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.
Not grandparent.

48
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:41,487
Slow down, turbo!

49
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:46,017
- That's not a dust storm.
- Nelson's torching his whole crop.

50
00:04:46,117 --> 00:04:47,160
Blight?

51
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,079
They're saying
it's the last harvest for okra.

52
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:51,915
Ever.

53
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:56,428
He should've planted corn
like the rest of us.

54
00:04:56,528 --> 00:04:59,305
Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley.
She's single.

55
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:00,974
What's that supposed to mean?

56
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:04,269
Repopulating the earth.
Start pulling your weight, young man.

57
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:08,431
Why don't you start
minding your own business, old man?

58
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,398
All right, Murph, give me second.

59
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:22,162
Third.

60
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:25,373
- Find a gear, dumb-ass.
- Grind it!

61
00:05:25,473 --> 00:05:26,616
Shut it, Tom!

62
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:30,395
- What'd you do, Murph?
- She didn't do nothing.

63
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,997
- Blew a tire is all.
- Murphy's Law.

64
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:34,712
Shut up!

65
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:37,085
- Grab the spare, Tom.
- That is the spare.

66
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:41,214
Get the patch kit!

67
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:45,685
- How am I supposed to patch it out here?
- You got to figure it out.

68
00:05:45,785 --> 00:05:47,845
I'm not always gonna be here
to help you.

69
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,989
What's going on, Murph?

70
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:01,367
Why did you and Mom name me
after something that's bad?

71
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:04,821
- We didn't.
- Murphy's Law?

72
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,834
Murphy's Law doesn't mean
that something bad will happen.

73
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:13,379
What it means is
whatever can happen will happen.

74
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:16,124
And that sounded just fine with us.

75
00:06:20,236 --> 00:06:21,879
Whoa!

76
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:23,756
Get in.

77
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:26,551
Get in, let's go.

78
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:30,013
What about the flat tire?

79
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:34,308
Yeah.

80
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:52,252
It's an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

81
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:53,911
Take the wheel, Tom.

82
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:00,710
Go, go, go!

83
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:03,963
Keep that aimed right at it.

84
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:14,507
Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

85
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:16,017
Right at it.

86
00:07:17,718 --> 00:07:18,961
Stay on it.

87
00:07:20,246 --> 00:07:21,530
Here we go.

88
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,359
Whoa.

89
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,075
Nice one, Tom.

90
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:39,916
Dad?

91
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:43,086
I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!

92
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:46,097
- Dad!
- Tom!

93
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:53,012
You told me to keep driving.

94
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:58,309
Well, I guess that answers the old
"If I asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.

95
00:08:01,421 --> 00:08:04,357
- We lost it.
- No, we didn't.

96
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:18,704
Want to give it a whirl?

97
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,087
This way.

98
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:32,552
Go.

99
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:36,556
Let's lay her down right there
at the edge of the reservoir.

100
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:42,562
Nicely done.

101
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:47,408
How long you think it's been up there?

102
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:50,119
Delhi Mission Control
went down, same as ours...

103
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:52,155
- ...ten years ago.
- Heh.

104
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:54,407
So for ten years?

105
00:08:57,268 --> 00:08:59,963
- Why did it come down so low?
- I don't know.

106
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:03,049
Maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something.

107
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:05,501
- What?
- Give me a large flatblade.

108
00:09:05,818 --> 00:09:08,588
Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.

109
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:15,344
What are you gonna do with it?

110
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:19,432
I'm gonna give it something
socially responsible to do...

111
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,642
like drive a combine.

112
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:23,728
Can't we just let it go?

113
00:09:25,922 --> 00:09:27,690
It wasn't hurting anybody.

114
00:09:29,258 --> 00:09:33,654
This thing needs to learn how to adapt,
Murph... like the rest of us.

115
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:40,254
How's this work? You guys come with?

116
00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:43,856
I've got class. This one needs to wait.

117
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,261
- What did you do?
- They'll tell you about it in there.

118
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:50,596
- Am I gonna be mad?
- Not with me.

119
00:09:50,696 --> 00:09:53,966
- Just please try not to.
- Hey. Relax.

120
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:56,719
I got this.

121
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:03,943
- Little late, Coop.
- Yeah, we had a flat.

122
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:07,688
And I guess you had to stop off
at the Asian fighter plane store.

123
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,534
No, actually, sir,
that's a surveillance drone.

124
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:14,487
With outstanding solar cells.
It's Indian.

125
00:10:14,804 --> 00:10:16,239
Take a seat.

126
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:18,866
So...

127
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:22,161
we got Tom's scores back.

128
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:24,630
He's going to make an excellent farmer.

129
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,301
Yeah, he's got a knack for it.
What about college?

130
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:32,221
The university only takes a handful.
They don't have the resources to...

131
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:34,682
I still pay my taxes.

132
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:36,884
Where's that money go?
There's no more armies.

133
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:39,720
Well, it doesn't go to the university.

134
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:45,093
- Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.
- You're ruling my son out for college now?

135
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:48,938
- The kid's 15.
- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.

136
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,108
What's your waistline? About what, 32?

137
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:56,162
- About a 33 inseam?
- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.

138
00:10:56,262 --> 00:11:00,783
It takes two numbers to measure your ass
but only one to measure my son's future?

139
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:04,504
Come on.
You're a well-educated man, Coop.

140
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:06,664
- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

141
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:12,178
Okay, well, right now
we don't need more engineers.

142
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:16,816
We didn't run out of television screens
and planes. We ran out of food.

143
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:20,436
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

144
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:23,014
- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.

145
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:27,819
We're a caretaker generation, Coop.
And things are getting better.

146
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,147
- Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...
- Are we done here, sir?

147
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,524
No.

148
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:36,527
Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.

149
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:39,372
Murph is a great kid.
She's really bright.

150
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:41,791
But she's been having
a little trouble lately.

151
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:45,336
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.

152
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:50,466
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
She always loved the pictures.

153
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:54,345
It's an old federal textbook. We've
replaced them with the corrected versions.

154
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:55,555
Corrected?

155
00:11:55,655 --> 00:12:00,084
Explaining how the Apollo missions
were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

156
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:08,559
You don't believe we went to the moon?

157
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:11,654
It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.

158
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:14,657
The Soviets bankrupted themselves
pouring resources...

159
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:18,327
- into rockets and other useless machines.
- "Useless machines."

160
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:22,582
If we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

161
00:12:22,682 --> 00:12:26,577
we need to teach our kids about this planet,
not tales of leaving it.

162
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:31,415
One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

163
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:34,894
If we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

164
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:39,015
the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.

165
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:42,268
Then she'd have been the one
listening to this instead of me...

166
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:45,754
which would have been a good thing,
because she was always...

167
00:12:46,038 --> 00:12:47,640
the calmer one.

168
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:50,793
I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.

169
00:12:51,544 --> 00:12:55,281
But Murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates over this...

170
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:59,744
Apollo nonsense. So we thought it best
to bring you in and see what ideas...

171
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:02,613
you might have for dealing
with her behavior on the home front.

172
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:06,834
Yeah, you know what?
There's a game tomorrow night.

173
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:09,128
She's going through
a bit of a baseball phase.

174
00:13:09,228 --> 00:13:13,541
Her favorite team is playing.
There's gonna be candy and soda and...

175
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:18,462
I think I'll take her to that.

176
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:25,252
How'd it go?

177
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,847
I got you suspended.

178
00:13:28,164 --> 00:13:29,598
- What?
- Cooper.

179
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,485
This is Cooper. Go.

180
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:35,488
Coop, those combines you rebuilt
went haywire.

181
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:37,857
Just reset the controllers.

182
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,818
I did that.
Now you should come take a look.

183
00:14:00,446 --> 00:14:03,616
One by one they've been peeling off
the fields and heading over.

184
00:14:03,716 --> 00:14:05,551
Something's interfering
with the compass.

185
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:09,430
Magnetism or some such.

186
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:56,936
Nothing special about which book.
I've been working on it, like you said.

187
00:14:57,586 --> 00:15:00,489
- I counted the spaces.
- Why?

188
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:04,518
In case the ghost
is trying to communicate.

189
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,854
I'm trying Morse.

190
00:15:07,138 --> 00:15:08,622
Morse?

191
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:10,107
Yeah.

192
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:12,918
- Dots and dashes, used...
- I know what Morse code is, Murph.

193
00:15:13,018 --> 00:15:16,238
I just don't think your bookshelf's
trying to talk to you.

194
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:32,012
Had to reset every compass clock and GPS
to offset for the anomaly.

195
00:15:32,204 --> 00:15:34,848
- Which is?
- I don't know.

196
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,736
If the house was built
on magnetic ore...

197
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:42,022
we'd have seen this the first time
we switched on the tractor.

198
00:15:44,592 --> 00:15:47,861
I hear your meeting at the school
didn't go so well.

199
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:50,197
Heh. You heard?

200
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:53,993
It's like we've forgotten
who we are, Donald.

201
00:15:55,561 --> 00:15:59,464
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

202
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:02,468
When I was a kid...

203
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:06,797
it felt like they made something new
every day. Some...

204
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:10,467
gadget or idea.
Like every day was Christmas.

205
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:16,015
But six billion people...
just try to imagine that.

206
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:20,019
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

207
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:25,716
This world isn't so bad.

208
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:31,312
And Tom will do just fine.
You're the one who doesn't belong.

209
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:34,425
Born 40 years too late,
or 40 years too early.

210
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:38,028
My daughter knew it, God bless her.

211
00:16:38,604 --> 00:16:41,498
And your kids know it. Especially Murph.

212
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:45,219
Well, we used to look up in the sky
and wonder...

213
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:47,996
at our place in the stars.

214
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:54,595
Now we just look down and worry
about our place in the dirt.

215
00:16:54,995 --> 00:16:57,931
Cooper, you were good at something...

216
00:16:58,165 --> 00:17:00,768
and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

217
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,095
I'm sorry.

218
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:08,734
You didn't expect this dirt
that was giving you this food...

219
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:12,154
to turn on you like that
and destroy you.

220
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:16,784
In April... I believe I'm right...
Fifteenth of April, I think.

221
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:21,589
This happened about 1:30 when that thing...
came off the top of that canyon.

222
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:27,553
In my day, we had real ballplayers.
Who are these bums?

223
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:32,466
In my day, people were too busy
fighting over food to even play baseball.

224
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:37,405
Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

225
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:40,132
School says you're gonna follow
in my footsteps.

226
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,184
I think that's great.

227
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:45,771
- You think that's great?
- You hate farming, Dad.

228
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:48,157
Grandpa said.

229
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:49,775
Grandpa said?

230
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:52,703
Listen, all that matters
is how you feel about it.

231
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:54,571
I like what you do.

232
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,782
I like our farm.

233
00:17:57,349 --> 00:17:59,043
You're gonna be great at it.

234
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:13,824
Let's get out of here.

235
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:22,683
All right, it's a doozy.

236
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:25,227
All right, gang, let's mask up.

237
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:30,566
- Tom? Murph? Check?
- Yeah.

238
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:26,705
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?

239
00:19:31,026 --> 00:19:32,211
Murph?

240
00:19:53,507 --> 00:19:54,900
The ghost.

241
00:19:56,051 --> 00:19:57,778
Grab your pillow.

242
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,405
You're sleeping in with Tom.

243
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:57,004
It's not a ghost.

244
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:03,844
It's gravity.

245
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:07,848
I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town.

246
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,311
You want to clean that up
when you've finished praying to it?

247
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:39,922
It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.

248
00:21:40,322 --> 00:21:42,482
Thick is one, thin is zero.

249
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:48,180
Coordinates.

250
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,268
Nope.

251
00:21:54,628 --> 00:21:55,896
Here we go.

252
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:58,857
Thirty-three.

253
00:22:01,718 --> 00:22:02,861
That's it.

254
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:05,822
I can't miss this!

255
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:09,326
Grandpa will be back
in a couple hours, Murph.

256
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:12,788
But you don't know
what you're gonna find.

257
00:22:13,689 --> 00:22:15,323
And that...

258
00:22:16,108 --> 00:22:18,293
is why I can't take you.

259
00:22:24,283 --> 00:22:25,509
Murph?

260
00:22:27,494 --> 00:22:31,098
Grandpa will be home in a while.
Tell him I'll call him on the radio.

261
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,522
Jesus.

262
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:41,408
- What are you doing?
- Heh-heh.

263
00:22:41,508 --> 00:22:43,735
Oh, you think this is funny?

264
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:46,405
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.

265
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,242
Make yourself useful.

266
00:23:53,497 --> 00:23:55,231
Hey, Murph?

267
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,001
Murph.

268
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:03,440
I think this is the end of the road.

269
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:08,487
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

270
00:24:09,554 --> 00:24:10,906
That's my girl.

271
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:39,860
Step away!

272
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,113
Don't shoot! I'm not armed.
My daughter's in the car.

273
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:50,946
Don't be afraid.

274
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,752
How did you find this place?

275
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:07,796
Where's my daughter?

276
00:25:07,988 --> 00:25:11,975
You had the coordinates for this facility
marked on your map. Where did you get them?

277
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,277
Where's my daughter?

278
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:16,596
Don't make me take you down again.
Sit down!

279
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,107
Oh, you still think
you're a Marine, pal?

280
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:21,893
Marines don't exist anymore.

281
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:27,115
- And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.
- Where did you find those coordinates?

282
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:29,868
But you don't look much
like a lawnmower.

283
00:25:29,968 --> 00:25:32,871
Think I'll turn you
into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

284
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:34,281
No, you won't.

285
00:25:35,807 --> 00:25:37,826
TARS, back down, please.

286
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:42,455
You know, you're taking a risk
using ex-military security.

287
00:25:42,814 --> 00:25:46,718
They're old, and their control units
are unpredictable.

288
00:25:46,818 --> 00:25:48,887
It's what the government could spare.

289
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:51,756
Who are you?

290
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:53,517
Dr. Brand.

291
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:56,094
I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.

292
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:57,971
What makes you think I'm not?

293
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,899
Wasn't near as cute, either.

294
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:03,602
Please, Dr. Brand.
I don't have any idea what this is.

295
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:06,905
Now I'm scared for my daughter
and want her by my side.

296
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:09,566
You give me that,
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

297
00:26:12,844 --> 00:26:15,947
Get the principals and the girl
in the conference room, please.

298
00:26:17,382 --> 00:26:20,160
Your daughter is fine. Bright kid.

299
00:26:20,644 --> 00:26:22,546
Must have a very smart mother.

300
00:26:22,646 --> 00:26:25,132
It's pretty clear
you don't want any visitors.

301
00:26:25,232 --> 00:26:29,294
So why don't you just let us back up from
your fence and we'll be on our way?

302
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:32,130
- It's not that simple.
- Well, sure, it is.

303
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:36,134
I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.

304
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,178
Yes, you do.

305
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:44,976
Dad!

306
00:26:47,546 --> 00:26:48,688
Hello, Cooper.

307
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:51,191
Professor Brand.

308
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,287
Explain to me
how you found this facility.

309
00:26:55,387 --> 00:26:58,749
Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled
upon it. We were on a salvage run...

310
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:01,626
You're sitting in the best-kept secret
in the world.

311
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:05,330
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

312
00:27:05,564 --> 00:27:09,843
Cooper, please.
Cooperate with these people.

313
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:11,253
Look.

314
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,838
It's kind of hard to explain.

315
00:27:14,072 --> 00:27:18,894
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

316
00:27:18,994 --> 00:27:20,395
What sort of anomaly?

317
00:27:20,495 --> 00:27:23,857
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

318
00:27:23,957 --> 00:27:27,944
You're going to have to be specific,
Mr. Cooper. Right now.

319
00:27:28,044 --> 00:27:29,396
It was gravity.

320
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,245
What sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?

321
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:40,707
Now, I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity, bud...

322
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:43,686
but you're not getting any answers
from us until I get assurances.

323
00:27:43,786 --> 00:27:45,578
- Assurances?
- Yeah.

324
00:27:46,313 --> 00:27:49,841
Like, that we're getting out of here.
And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

325
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,931
- Don't you know who we are, Coop?
- No, professor, I don't.

326
00:27:56,031 --> 00:27:58,133
You know my father, Professor Brand.

327
00:27:58,658 --> 00:28:00,051
We're NASA.

328
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:04,055
- NASA?
- NASA.

329
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:06,182
The same NASA you flew for.

330
00:28:17,135 --> 00:28:18,870
I heard they shut you down, sir...

331
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:23,041
for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere onto starving people.

332
00:28:23,141 --> 00:28:25,544
When they realized
that killing other people was...

333
00:28:25,644 --> 00:28:28,547
not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

334
00:28:28,647 --> 00:28:30,715
- In secret.
- Why secret?

335
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:34,811
Because public opinion wouldn't allow
spending on space exploration.

336
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:37,505
Not while you're struggling
to put food on the table.

337
00:28:38,823 --> 00:28:40,091
Blight.

338
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,687
Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.

339
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:46,806
Now there's just corn.

340
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,067
And we're growing more
than we ever have.

341
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:53,438
But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

342
00:28:53,922 --> 00:28:56,524
the corn will die.

343
00:28:57,175 --> 00:28:58,318
Soon.

344
00:29:03,515 --> 00:29:07,202
We'll find a way, professor.
We always have.

345
00:29:07,852 --> 00:29:11,956
Driven by the unshakable faith
the Earth is ours.

346
00:29:12,357 --> 00:29:16,461
Not just ours, no. But it is our home.

347
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:22,976
Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

348
00:29:23,076 --> 00:29:28,481
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

349
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:32,110
The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.

350
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,479
And your daughter's generation...

351
00:29:35,947 --> 00:29:38,366
will be the last to survive on Earth.

352
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:42,153
Murph is feeling tired. I was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office.

353
00:29:42,554 --> 00:29:44,155
Yeah. Thank you.

354
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,292
Alright...

355
00:29:48,893 --> 00:29:52,497
now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world.

356
00:29:53,064 --> 00:29:56,668
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

357
00:30:02,407 --> 00:30:03,550
Rangers.

358
00:30:03,742 --> 00:30:08,805
The last components of our one versatile ship
in orbit, the Endurance.

359
00:30:08,997 --> 00:30:10,723
Our final expedition.

360
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:14,477
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

361
00:30:15,003 --> 00:30:16,396
The Lazarus missions.

362
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:19,691
- Oh, that sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.

363
00:30:19,924 --> 00:30:22,026
Sure, but he had to die
in the first place.

364
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:25,330
There's not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life...

365
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,999
and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.

366
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:30,869
That doesn't even qualify as futile.

367
00:30:32,437 --> 00:30:33,872
Where'd you send them?

368
00:30:34,189 --> 00:30:35,674
Cooper...

369
00:30:35,774 --> 00:30:40,637
I can't tell you anymore
unless you agree to pilot this craft.

370
00:30:40,737 --> 00:30:44,132
- You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

371
00:30:44,324 --> 00:30:46,551
This team never left the simulator.

372
00:30:46,785 --> 00:30:50,647
We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

373
00:30:50,747 --> 00:30:52,348
Without even knowing it?

374
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:57,612
An hour ago, you didn't even know
I was alive. You were going anyway.

375
00:30:57,712 --> 00:31:01,441
We had no choice.
But something sent you here.

376
00:31:01,674 --> 00:31:04,486
- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?

377
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:14,370
How long would I be gone?

378
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:18,074
Hard to know. Years?

379
00:31:18,483 --> 00:31:22,754
- I've got kids, professor.
- Get out there and save them.

380
00:31:26,032 --> 00:31:27,475
Who's "they"?

381
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:31,604
We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

382
00:31:31,704 --> 00:31:35,400
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

383
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,728
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

384
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:41,797
Yeah, over the Straights.

385
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:45,410
My crash.
Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

386
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,819
Exactly.

387
00:31:47,554 --> 00:31:52,542
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

388
00:31:52,642 --> 00:31:54,711
Out near Saturn...

389
00:31:54,811 --> 00:31:56,996
a disturbance of space-time.

390
00:31:59,023 --> 00:32:02,252
- Is that a Wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

391
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,798
- And it leads where?
- Another galaxy.

392
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,769
A wormhole's not
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

393
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:12,387
Someone placed it there.

394
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,681
"They"?

395
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:19,269
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

396
00:32:19,627 --> 00:32:24,366
That Wormhole lets us travel to other stars.
It came along right as we needed it.

397
00:32:24,466 --> 00:32:27,452
They've put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach.

398
00:32:27,552 --> 00:32:29,537
Twelve, in fact,
from our initial probes.

399
00:32:29,637 --> 00:32:32,082
You sent probes into that?

400
00:32:32,182 --> 00:32:35,585
We sent people into it. Ten years ago.

401
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,421
The Lazarus missions.

402
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:42,333
Twelve possible worlds,
twelve Ranger launches carrying...

403
00:32:42,692 --> 00:32:48,206
the bravest humans ever to live...
led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

404
00:32:48,306 --> 00:32:51,476
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

405
00:32:51,576 --> 00:32:53,603
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

406
00:32:53,703 --> 00:32:56,981
making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

407
00:32:57,081 --> 00:33:01,019
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

408
00:33:01,252 --> 00:33:05,740
then they could send out a signal,
bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

409
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,984
And what if the world
didn't show promise?

410
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,028
Hence the bravery.

411
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,331
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

412
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:14,857
No.

413
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:18,294
Data transmission back through
the Wormhole is rudimentary.

414
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:23,508
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

415
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:25,501
And one system shows promise.

416
00:33:25,735 --> 00:33:28,679
One. That's a bit
of a long shot, isn't it?

417
00:33:29,113 --> 00:33:32,050
One system with three potential worlds?

418
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:34,352
No long shot.

419
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,347
Okay.

420
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:40,591
So if we find a home...

421
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:46,522
- ...then what?
- That's the long shot.

422
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:50,068
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

423
00:33:50,468 --> 00:33:53,529
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

424
00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:08,169
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

425
00:34:08,403 --> 00:34:11,005
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

426
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,310
- Both. Plan A.
- How do you get it off the ground?

427
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:19,314
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

428
00:34:19,414 --> 00:34:23,951
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

429
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:28,856
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

430
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:31,517
But you haven't solved it yet.

431
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:33,945
That's why there's Plan B.

432
00:34:34,345 --> 00:34:39,125
The problem is gravity. How to get
a viable amount of human life off the planet.

433
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:40,618
This is one way.

434
00:34:40,852 --> 00:34:43,454
Plan B: A population bomb.

435
00:34:43,688 --> 00:34:48,543
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

436
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:50,720
How would you raise them?

437
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,348
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

438
00:34:53,448 --> 00:34:57,427
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

439
00:34:58,036 --> 00:35:01,397
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

440
00:35:01,497 --> 00:35:04,976
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

441
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:07,111
This takes care of that.

442
00:35:07,211 --> 00:35:09,772
But what about the people here?
You just...

443
00:35:10,048 --> 00:35:13,559
You give up on them? My kids?

444
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:17,238
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

445
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,335
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

446
00:35:22,435 --> 00:35:24,954
You're asking me to hang everything...

447
00:35:25,897 --> 00:35:27,331
on an almost.

448
00:35:27,774 --> 00:35:30,168
I'm asking you to trust me.

449
00:35:33,154 --> 00:35:34,922
Find us a new home.

450
00:35:35,573 --> 00:35:37,675
And by the time you return...

451
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:40,928
I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

452
00:35:41,788 --> 00:35:43,473
I give you my word.

453
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,612
Go away!

454
00:36:08,189 --> 00:36:09,507
Murph.

455
00:36:09,607 --> 00:36:12,710
Go! If you're leaving, just go.

456
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:18,441
This world was never enough
for you, was it, Coop?

457
00:36:19,075 --> 00:36:23,329
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

458
00:36:23,788 --> 00:36:25,723
And it excites me? Heh.

459
00:36:26,332 --> 00:36:28,860
No, that does not make it wrong.

460
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,689
It might. Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

461
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,743
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

462
00:36:36,843 --> 00:36:39,228
And the foundation's solid.

463
00:36:42,098 --> 00:36:47,203
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

464
00:36:47,395 --> 00:36:48,746
"Next year."

465
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:53,084
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

466
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:58,047
This world's a treasure, Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

467
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,556
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

468
00:37:09,584 --> 00:37:12,862
Tom will be all right, but you got
to make things right with Murph.

469
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:14,605
I will.

470
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:18,234
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

471
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,872
You have to talk to me, Murph.

472
00:37:33,274 --> 00:37:35,468
I need to fix this before I go.

473
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:38,546
Then I'll keep it broken
so you have to stay.

474
00:37:40,031 --> 00:37:45,136
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

475
00:37:45,411 --> 00:37:47,538
She said, "Now...

476
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:53,519
we're just here
to be memories for our kids."

477
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:01,152
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.

478
00:38:04,806 --> 00:38:08,659
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.

479
00:38:10,186 --> 00:38:12,455
You said ghosts didn't exist.

480
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,421
That's right, Murph.

481
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:25,367
Murph, look at me.

482
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:30,514
I can't be your ghost right now.

483
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:34,510
I need to exist.

484
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:37,855
They chose me.

485
00:38:38,464 --> 00:38:42,526
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

486
00:38:45,054 --> 00:38:47,657
That's exactly why you can't go.

487
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:52,828
I figured out the message.

488
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:56,424
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

489
00:38:56,524 --> 00:38:57,959
"Stay."

490
00:38:58,234 --> 00:39:01,212
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

491
00:39:02,071 --> 00:39:03,598
You don't believe me.

492
00:39:03,698 --> 00:39:06,559
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

493
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:09,720
Why...? You're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"

494
00:39:09,954 --> 00:39:13,691
- No, I'm coming back.
- When?

495
00:39:26,304 --> 00:39:29,040
One for you, one for me.

496
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,410
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...

497
00:39:32,643 --> 00:39:35,987
traveling near the speed of light, or...

498
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:38,674
near a black hole...

499
00:39:38,774 --> 00:39:43,621
time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

500
00:39:44,906 --> 00:39:47,299
When we get back...

501
00:39:47,825 --> 00:39:49,310
we're gonna compare.

502
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:52,338
- Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

503
00:39:53,122 --> 00:39:57,893
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

504
00:39:58,169 --> 00:40:01,504
"What?" Imagine that!

505
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:06,285
Aw, Murph...

506
00:40:06,385 --> 00:40:09,413
You have no idea when you're coming back.

507
00:40:10,806 --> 00:40:12,952
No idea at all!

508
00:40:15,436 --> 00:40:17,630
Murph, don't...
Don't make me leave like this.

509
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,331
Come on, Murph!

510
00:40:19,732 --> 00:40:22,468
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

511
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:30,801
Hey...

512
00:40:31,243 --> 00:40:35,231
I love you. Forever. You hear me?

513
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:38,842
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.

514
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,975
I'm coming back.

515
00:41:03,901 --> 00:41:06,470
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

516
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:08,380
Just fine.

517
00:41:14,745 --> 00:41:15,971
I love you, Tom.

518
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:18,608
- Travel safe?
- Yeah.

519
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:21,027
You look after our place
for me, all right?

520
00:41:21,127 --> 00:41:22,853
All right?

521
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:31,136
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?

522
00:41:32,138 --> 00:41:34,064
I'll make sure they bring it back.

523
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:37,985
Look after my kids, Donald!

524
00:41:50,156 --> 00:41:53,884
Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...

525
00:41:54,852 --> 00:41:56,604
- Dad!
- ...nine...

526
00:41:56,704 --> 00:41:58,055
Dad!

527
00:41:58,781 --> 00:42:00,425
...eight...

528
00:42:01,158 --> 00:42:03,761
- seven...
- Dad!

529
00:42:03,994 --> 00:42:05,337
...six...

530
00:42:06,513 --> 00:42:09,233
five, main engine start, four...

531
00:42:10,668 --> 00:42:11,935
three...

532
00:42:12,503 --> 00:42:13,729
two...

533
00:42:14,546 --> 00:42:16,732
one. Booster ignition and...

534
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,460
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

535
00:42:32,656 --> 00:42:35,593
Prepare for stage one separation.

536
00:42:35,826 --> 00:42:36,969
Stage one.

537
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:44,768
There is Mach 1.

538
00:42:45,628 --> 00:42:49,440
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

539
00:42:51,217 --> 00:42:54,612
They gave him a humor setting
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

540
00:42:54,845 --> 00:42:56,580
He thinks it relaxes us.

541
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,575
A giant sarcastic robot.

542
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:01,836
What a great idea!

543
00:43:01,936 --> 00:43:04,714
I have a cue light I can use
when I'm joking if you like.

544
00:43:04,814 --> 00:43:05,923
That'd probably help.

545
00:43:06,023 --> 00:43:10,044
You can use it to find your way back
to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.

546
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:14,098
- What's your humor setting, TARS?
- That's 100 percent.

547
00:43:14,198 --> 00:43:16,091
Let's bring it on down to 75, please.

548
00:43:16,325 --> 00:43:18,260
Stage two separation.

549
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:31,198
All feeds going manual.

550
00:43:31,298 --> 00:43:33,216
Going manual.

551
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,246
Deactivate probe heater one,
two and three.

552
00:43:37,346 --> 00:43:38,489
Check.

553
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:46,997
- Taking control.
- This is handover to you.

554
00:43:50,734 --> 00:43:53,128
- A.D.F. check.
- Over.

555
00:43:53,362 --> 00:43:57,099
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.

556
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:00,636
- One hundred percent.
- Ex-mites.

557
00:44:09,503 --> 00:44:14,316
It's hard leaving everything.
My kids. Your father.

558
00:44:14,842 --> 00:44:17,286
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

559
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:20,531
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

560
00:44:22,725 --> 00:44:24,335
Just being honest.

561
00:44:24,435 --> 00:44:26,870
I don't think you need to be that honest.

562
00:44:27,188 --> 00:44:29,673
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

563
00:44:29,773 --> 00:44:32,468
- Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

564
00:44:32,568 --> 00:44:35,266
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic,

565
00:44:35,366 --> 00:44:38,432
nor the safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

566
00:44:38,532 --> 00:44:40,092
Okay.

567
00:44:40,451 --> 00:44:43,178
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

568
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:50,102
We are coming up on the Endurance.
Twelve minutes out.

569
00:45:07,102 --> 00:45:09,204
Okay. Taking control.

570
00:45:12,566 --> 00:45:15,544
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

571
00:45:28,457 --> 00:45:29,683
It's all you, Doyle.

572
00:45:48,143 --> 00:45:50,704
Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.

573
00:45:55,776 --> 00:45:58,429
- I feel good.
- Take us home.

574
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:08,464
- Lock.
- Target locked.

575
00:46:08,564 --> 00:46:10,566
- Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

576
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:11,809
Good job.

577
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:48,679
Door's not charging. Never mind.

578
00:47:11,352 --> 00:47:13,162
Cooper, you should have control.

579
00:47:13,395 --> 00:47:14,997
Control here.

580
00:47:16,315 --> 00:47:19,042
Communication with ring module active.

581
00:47:25,407 --> 00:47:27,050
Oh, wow.

582
00:47:32,748 --> 00:47:34,016
That's initiate.

583
00:47:41,465 --> 00:47:44,067
- Are we ready to spin?
- Just a sec.

584
00:47:55,396 --> 00:47:57,831
- Hello, CASE.
- Hello, TARS.

585
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,709
All right, we're all set.

586
00:48:01,068 --> 00:48:02,669
All right, let's do it.

587
00:48:20,879 --> 00:48:22,481
Heh.

588
00:48:31,723 --> 00:48:33,116
Thirty percent of spin.

589
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,375
One G.

590
00:48:42,025 --> 00:48:44,127
How's gravity treating you back there?

591
00:48:44,361 --> 00:48:46,029
Well.

592
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:50,559
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

593
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:51,769
- Yeah.
- You all right?

594
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:54,054
Yeah, I just need a minute.

595
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:57,663
I think we have some Dramamine
in the hab pod, I'm just gonna get that

596
00:48:57,763 --> 00:48:59,623
or maybe in the cryo-beds.
I'll just be a sec.

597
00:48:59,723 --> 00:49:01,478
- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

598
00:49:01,712 --> 00:49:03,339
- Bring a lot.
- Heh-heh-heh.

599
00:49:12,014 --> 00:49:14,992
Amelia, be safe.

600
00:49:15,225 --> 00:49:18,796
- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will, Dad.

601
00:49:18,896 --> 00:49:24,418
It looks good for your trajectory.
We've calculated two years to Saturn.

602
00:49:24,868 --> 00:49:26,670
That's a lot of Dramamine.

603
00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:29,840
Look after my family,
will you, please, sir?

604
00:49:30,282 --> 00:49:33,376
We'll be waiting for you
when you get back.

605
00:49:33,577 --> 00:49:37,514
A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.

606
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:43,687
Do not go gentle into that good night

607
00:49:44,054 --> 00:49:48,400
Old age should burn
and rave at close of day

608
00:49:49,468 --> 00:49:54,531
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light

609
00:49:55,307 --> 00:49:59,202
Though wise men at their end
Know dark is right

610
00:49:59,436 --> 00:50:02,414
Because their words had forked
No lightning they

611
00:50:02,731 --> 00:50:06,376
Do not go gentle into that good night

612
00:50:06,944 --> 00:50:11,581
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light

613
00:50:27,881 --> 00:50:29,650
- You good?
- Yeah.

614
00:50:30,467 --> 00:50:32,069
Okay, thank you, sir.

615
00:50:35,472 --> 00:50:37,107
Here. Pills.

616
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,278
So alone.

617
00:50:41,478 --> 00:50:43,505
We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.

618
00:50:43,605 --> 00:50:45,048
No, I mean them.

619
00:50:46,441 --> 00:50:49,836
It's a perfect planet,
and we won't find another one like her.

620
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,674
No, it's not like looking
for a new condo.

621
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,968
The human race is going to be...

622
00:50:57,169 --> 00:50:58,479
adrift...

623
00:50:58,579 --> 00:51:02,182
desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches its breath.

624
00:51:02,666 --> 00:51:04,601
We need to find that rock.

625
00:51:04,835 --> 00:51:09,690
And our three prospects are at the edge
of what might sustain human life.

626
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:12,618
Laura Miller's planet is first.

627
00:51:12,718 --> 00:51:14,945
- Laura started our biology program.
- COOPER:

628
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:23,120
- Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.

629
00:51:23,854 --> 00:51:26,907
Oh... Wolf's a particle physicist.

630
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,336
None of them had families?

631
00:51:32,279 --> 00:51:35,224
No. No attachments. My father insisted.

632
00:51:35,324 --> 00:51:38,936
They all knew the odds against
ever seeing another human being again.

633
00:51:39,036 --> 00:51:41,063
I'm hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

634
00:51:41,163 --> 00:51:43,148
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?

635
00:51:43,248 --> 00:51:45,234
He's remarkable. He's the best of us.

636
00:51:45,334 --> 00:51:49,780
He inspired 11 people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history.

637
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,532
Scientists, explorers.

638
00:51:51,632 --> 00:51:55,819
That's what I love.
You know, out there we face great odds.

639
00:51:56,219 --> 00:51:57,938
Death, but...

640
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:00,824
not evil.

641
00:52:01,016 --> 00:52:02,868
You don't think nature can be evil?

642
00:52:03,143 --> 00:52:06,112
No. Formidable. Frightening. But...

643
00:52:06,605 --> 00:52:08,707
...no, not evil.

644
00:52:09,858 --> 00:52:13,170
Is a lion evil
because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

645
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,972
Just what we take with us, then.

646
00:52:16,114 --> 00:52:17,457
Yeah.

647
00:52:17,574 --> 00:52:19,726
This crew represents
the best of humanity.

648
00:52:19,826 --> 00:52:21,061
Even me?

649
00:52:21,161 --> 00:52:23,230
You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.

650
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,731
There you go.

651
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:27,276
- Don't stay up.
- I'll be there in a minute.

652
00:52:27,376 --> 00:52:31,521
Just remember, Coop,
you are literally wasting your breath.

653
00:52:38,095 --> 00:52:41,364
Hey, TARS? Let's go over
that trajectory one more time.

654
00:52:41,598 --> 00:52:43,366
Eight months to Mars.

655
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:46,670
Counter-orbital slingshot around.
Fourteen months to Saturn.

656
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:48,255
Nothing's changed on that.

657
00:52:48,355 --> 00:52:50,540
Just let me ask you something.

658
00:52:52,693 --> 00:52:56,254
- Dr. Brand and Edmunds...
- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

659
00:52:57,614 --> 00:53:00,684
Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?

660
00:53:00,784 --> 00:53:02,269
I wouldn't know.

661
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:05,339
Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"
or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?

662
00:53:05,439 --> 00:53:08,268
I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.

663
00:53:10,127 --> 00:53:12,395
But not a poker face, Slick.

664
00:53:24,641 --> 00:53:26,192
Hey, guys.

665
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:29,496
Dad's about to go down for the long nap.

666
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:32,424
So I wanted to give you an update.

667
00:53:34,192 --> 00:53:37,445
The Earth looks amazing from here.

668
00:53:38,447 --> 00:53:41,350
You can't see any of the dust. Heh.

669
00:53:42,683 --> 00:53:45,679
I really hope you guys are doing great.

670
00:53:45,912 --> 00:53:48,621
I know you're gonna get this message.
Professor Brand's assured me that...

671
00:53:48,721 --> 00:53:50,180
he's gonna get it to you.

672
00:53:50,709 --> 00:53:52,853
Know that I love you.

673
00:53:54,171 --> 00:53:56,606
- Is it him?
- I don't think so, Murph.

674
00:54:03,388 --> 00:54:05,156
You must be Donald.

675
00:54:07,267 --> 00:54:08,535
Hello, Murph.

676
00:54:09,186 --> 00:54:11,288
Why are you in my dad's truck?

677
00:54:11,813 --> 00:54:14,082
He wanted me
to bring it for your brother.

678
00:54:14,733 --> 00:54:17,002
He sent you a message.

679
00:54:19,988 --> 00:54:22,057
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.

680
00:54:22,157 --> 00:54:26,344
If you record any messages,
I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.

681
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:30,098
Murph is a bright spark.

682
00:54:30,999 --> 00:54:33,610
Maybe I should fan the flame.

683
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:36,363
She's already making fools
of her teachers.

684
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:39,599
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

685
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:43,520
- So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.

686
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:47,933
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

687
00:55:28,828 --> 00:55:33,036
...administration wants me to repeat
Plant Pathology. Which sucks.

688
00:55:33,436 --> 00:55:36,748
But they said I could start
Advanced Agriculture a year early.

689
00:55:38,441 --> 00:55:42,420
All right, I got to go, Dad.
Hope you're safe up there.

690
00:55:46,366 --> 00:55:48,018
Sorry, Coop.

691
00:55:48,118 --> 00:55:53,056
I asked Murph to say hi,
but she's as stubborn as her old man.

692
00:55:53,373 --> 00:55:55,308
I'll try again next time.

693
00:56:10,223 --> 00:56:11,875
You all right, Rom?

694
00:56:14,144 --> 00:56:17,914
This gets to me, Cooper. This. This.

695
00:56:18,315 --> 00:56:21,259
Millimeters of aluminum, that's it,
and then nothing...

696
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:25,422
out there for millions of miles
won't kill us in seconds.

697
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:28,225
You know that some of the finest...

698
00:56:28,325 --> 00:56:32,262
solo yachtsmen in the world
don't know how to swim?

699
00:56:32,746 --> 00:56:36,016
They don't know how.
And if they go overboard, psst, they're done.

700
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:39,728
We're explorers, Rom.

701
00:56:41,171 --> 00:56:44,574
This is our boat. Here.

702
00:57:11,284 --> 00:57:13,103
This is from the... relay probe?

703
00:57:13,203 --> 00:57:15,346
It was in orbit around the Wormhole.

704
00:57:15,747 --> 00:57:18,859
This is the Wormhole,
and every time we'd come around...

705
00:57:18,959 --> 00:57:22,270
we would receive images
from the other side of the foreign galaxy.

706
00:57:22,504 --> 00:57:24,698
Oh, yeah.
Like swinging a periscope around.

707
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:25,949
Exactly.

708
00:57:26,049 --> 00:57:30,653
So we got a pretty good idea
what we're gonna find on the other side?

709
00:57:31,638 --> 00:57:33,073
Navigationally.

710
00:57:34,432 --> 00:57:38,486
Guys? Looks like we'll be approaching
the Wormhole in about three hours.

711
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:45,910
Hey, Coop?

712
00:57:46,486 --> 00:57:49,556
- Can we stop the spinning?
- Why?

713
00:57:49,656 --> 00:57:52,292
Because we're close enough
to see it now?

714
00:57:53,827 --> 00:57:55,020
All right.

715
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,304
Thanks.

716
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,987
There, that's it! That's the Wormhole!

717
00:58:04,087 --> 00:58:07,616
Say it, don't spray it, Rom. It's a sphere.

718
00:58:07,716 --> 00:58:11,978
Of course it is. What, you...?
You thought it would just be a hole?

719
00:58:12,887 --> 00:58:16,074
No, it's just that all the illustrations
I've ever seen, they...

720
00:58:16,516 --> 00:58:19,702
In the illustrations,
they're trying to show you how it works.

721
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:24,382
So they say you want to go
from here to there.

722
00:58:24,482 --> 00:58:26,806
But it's too far, right?

723
00:58:27,193 --> 00:58:32,090
So a Wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through...

724
00:58:32,323 --> 00:58:33,975
a higher dimension.

725
00:58:34,075 --> 00:58:35,635
Okay, so...

726
00:58:35,869 --> 00:58:38,806
to show that,
they've turned three-dimensional space

727
00:58:38,906 --> 00:58:43,985
into two dimensions which turns a Wormhole
into two dimensions, a circle.

728
00:58:44,085 --> 00:58:46,637
What's a circle in three dimensions?

729
00:58:47,547 --> 00:58:49,149
- A sphere.
- Exactly.

730
00:58:49,466 --> 00:58:51,067
A spherical hole.

731
00:58:51,509 --> 00:58:54,445
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

732
00:58:54,763 --> 00:58:59,534
I'm not thanking anybody until we
get out of here in one piece, Rom.

733
00:59:06,449 --> 00:59:08,468
Any trick to this, Doyle?

734
00:59:09,402 --> 00:59:11,171
No one knows.

735
00:59:18,203 --> 00:59:19,971
The others made it, right?

736
00:59:21,915 --> 00:59:23,683
At least some of them.

737
00:59:55,532 --> 00:59:58,801
Everybody ready to say goodbye
to our solar system?

738
00:59:59,577 --> 01:00:01,679
To our galaxy.

739
01:00:03,498 --> 01:00:04,641
Here we go.

740
01:00:37,157 --> 01:00:40,727
The controls won't work here.
We're passing through the bulk.

741
01:00:40,827 --> 01:00:45,348
It's space beyond our three dimensions.
All you can do is record and observe.

742
01:00:56,426 --> 01:00:57,568
What is that?

743
01:00:59,846 --> 01:01:03,950
- I think it's them.
- Distorting space-time.

744
01:01:05,935 --> 01:01:07,120
Don't! Don't!

745
01:01:35,048 --> 01:01:36,599
What was that?

746
01:01:39,302 --> 01:01:40,903
The first handshake.

747
01:01:42,472 --> 01:01:43,914
We're...

748
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:46,776
We're here.

749
01:02:06,829 --> 01:02:09,149
So the lost communications came through.

750
01:02:09,249 --> 01:02:12,193
- How?
- The relay on this side cached them.

751
01:02:12,293 --> 01:02:15,938
So years of basic data.
No real surprises.

752
01:02:16,756 --> 01:02:20,460
Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,
as has Dr. Mann's.

753
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,954
Edmunds' went down three years ago.

754
01:02:23,054 --> 01:02:24,330
Transmitter failure?

755
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:27,500
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up
right until it went dark.

756
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,419
But Miller's still
looks good though, right?

757
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:31,913
- Because she's coming up fast.
- DOYLE:

758
01:02:32,272 --> 01:02:34,374
With one complication.

759
01:02:34,691 --> 01:02:37,760
The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.

760
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,597
- Gargantua?
- It's what we're calling the black hole.

761
01:02:40,697 --> 01:02:43,057
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets
both orbit it.

762
01:02:43,157 --> 01:02:46,436
- And Miller's is on the horizon?
- As a basketball around a hoop.

763
01:02:46,536 --> 01:02:48,605
Landing there takes us
dangerously close.

764
01:02:48,705 --> 01:02:52,058
And a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

765
01:02:54,544 --> 01:02:57,614
Look, I could swing around
that neutron star to decelerate.

766
01:02:57,714 --> 01:02:59,457
No, it's not that. It's time.

767
01:02:59,557 --> 01:03:04,362
The gravity on that planet will slow
our clock compared to Earth's drastically.

768
01:03:04,887 --> 01:03:06,122
How bad?

769
01:03:06,222 --> 01:03:09,867
Every hour we spend
on that planet will be...

770
01:03:10,643 --> 01:03:12,912
seven years back on Earth.

771
01:03:13,688 --> 01:03:14,831
Jesus.

772
01:03:15,064 --> 01:03:16,833
Well, that's relativity, folks.

773
01:03:18,151 --> 01:03:20,678
Well, we can't just drop down
there without...

774
01:03:20,778 --> 01:03:22,722
Cooper, we have a mission.

775
01:03:22,822 --> 01:03:25,475
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,
and our mission Plan A is...

776
01:03:25,575 --> 01:03:28,811
to find a planet that can habitate
the people that are living on Earth right now.

777
01:03:28,911 --> 01:03:31,814
You can't just think about your family.
Now you have to think bigger than that.

778
01:03:31,914 --> 01:03:34,993
I am thinking about my family
and millions of other families, okay?

779
01:03:35,093 --> 01:03:39,647
Plan A does not work if the people on Earth
are dead by the time we pull it off.

780
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:44,610
No. It doesn't.
That's why there's a Plan B.

781
01:03:46,429 --> 01:03:49,472
Okay. Cooper's right.
We need to think of time as a resource,

782
01:03:49,572 --> 01:03:52,034
just like oxygen and food.
Going down it's gonna cost us.

783
01:03:54,312 --> 01:03:55,980
All right, look.

784
01:03:56,773 --> 01:04:00,301
Dr. Mann's data is promising,
but it's gonna take months to get there.

785
01:04:00,401 --> 01:04:02,679
And Edmunds', it's even further.

786
01:04:02,779 --> 01:04:07,016
Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has
is very promising. It's water, it's organics...

787
01:04:07,116 --> 01:04:09,352
- You don't find that every day.
- No, you don't.

788
01:04:09,452 --> 01:04:11,854
And just think about the resources,
including time...

789
01:04:11,954 --> 01:04:14,557
that would be spent
trying to get back here.

790
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:17,043
- Romilly...
- Yeah?

791
01:04:17,143 --> 01:04:21,447
...how far off from Miller's planet do we
have to be to stay out of the time shift?

792
01:04:21,547 --> 01:04:23,283
Just back from the cusp.

793
01:04:23,383 --> 01:04:26,411
All right, which is here,
just outside of Miller's planet.

794
01:04:26,511 --> 01:04:28,404
- Right.
- Okay.

795
01:04:29,222 --> 01:04:32,083
Here's Gargantua.
Here's Miller's planet.

796
01:04:32,183 --> 01:04:35,420
Instead of taking the Endurance
into orbit around Miller's planet...

797
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,464
which would conserve fuel,
but we would lose a lot of time...

798
01:04:38,564 --> 01:04:41,732
what if we take a wider orbit
around Gargantua,

799
01:04:41,832 --> 01:04:45,388
parallel with Miller's planet
outside of this time shift, to here?

800
01:04:45,488 --> 01:04:48,349
Then we take the Ranger down,
we get Miller, we get her samples.

801
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:51,227
We come back, we analyze, we debrief.
We're in, we're out.

802
01:04:51,327 --> 01:04:53,730
We lose a little fuel,
but we save a whole lot of time.

803
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:55,532
- That'll work.
- That's good.

804
01:04:55,632 --> 01:04:58,159
There's no time for monkey business
or chit-chat down there.

805
01:04:58,259 --> 01:05:01,121
So, TARS,
you should definitely stay here.

806
01:05:01,221 --> 01:05:03,740
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

807
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:07,958
If we're talking about a couple years,
I could use the time to research gravity.

808
01:05:08,058 --> 01:05:10,621
Observations from the Wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

809
01:05:10,721 --> 01:05:12,457
TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.

810
01:05:12,557 --> 01:05:17,378
Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting,
but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.

811
01:05:17,478 --> 01:05:20,089
- You got it?
- I wouldn't leave you behind...

812
01:05:20,189 --> 01:05:21,332
Dr. Brand.

813
01:05:25,903 --> 01:05:27,630
- You ready, CASE?
- Yup.

814
01:05:28,489 --> 01:05:32,093
- You don't say much, do you?
- TARS talks plenty for both of us.

815
01:05:33,202 --> 01:05:34,345
Detach.

816
01:05:41,544 --> 01:05:44,605
- Romilly, are you reading these forces?
- It's unbelievable.

817
01:05:47,717 --> 01:05:50,244
A literal heart of darkness.

818
01:05:54,015 --> 01:05:56,793
If we could just see
the collapsed star inside...

819
01:05:56,893 --> 01:05:59,745
the singularity, yeah,
we'd solve gravity.

820
01:06:00,062 --> 01:06:03,424
- And we can't get anything from it?
- Nothing escapes that horizon.

821
01:06:03,524 --> 01:06:04,926
Not even light.

822
01:06:05,026 --> 01:06:08,629
- The answer's there, just no way to see it.
- There's Miller's planet.

823
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:13,233
Goodbye, Ranger.

824
01:06:25,338 --> 01:06:27,698
This is fast for atmospheric entry.

825
01:06:27,798 --> 01:06:30,151
- Should we use the thrusters to slow?
- No.

826
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:33,913
I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics
to save some fuel.

827
01:06:34,013 --> 01:06:35,289
Air brake?

828
01:06:35,389 --> 01:06:39,001
- We want to get down fast, don't we?
- We want to get there in one piece.

829
01:06:39,101 --> 01:06:42,204
- Hang on.
- Brand, Doyle, get ready.

830
01:06:57,954 --> 01:07:00,523
- We should ease!
- Hands where I can see them.

831
01:07:00,623 --> 01:07:04,026
The only time I went down was
when a machine was easing at the wrong time.

832
01:07:04,126 --> 01:07:07,029
- A little caution...
- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.

833
01:07:07,129 --> 01:07:09,398
- Cooper, it's too damn fast!
- I got this.

834
01:07:14,136 --> 01:07:18,240
- Should I disable the feedback?
- No. I need to feel the air.

835
01:07:22,344 --> 01:07:23,612
Here we go.

836
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:28,000
It's just water!

837
01:07:29,402 --> 01:07:31,003
The stuff of life.

838
01:07:31,362 --> 01:07:32,847
Twelve hundred meters.

839
01:07:32,947 --> 01:07:35,057
- Do we have a fix on the beacon?
- Got it!

840
01:07:35,157 --> 01:07:37,852
- Can you maneuver?
- I'll need to shave some speed.

841
01:07:37,952 --> 01:07:40,680
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.
Everybody hang on!

842
01:07:42,999 --> 01:07:44,141
Seven hundred.

843
01:07:46,168 --> 01:07:48,270
On my cue, CASE. On my cue.

844
01:07:51,674 --> 01:07:53,275
Five hundred meters.

845
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:03,786
Fire!

846
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:19,677
- Very graceful.
- No.

847
01:08:20,202 --> 01:08:23,388
But very efficient.

848
01:08:24,749 --> 01:08:27,026
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

849
01:08:27,126 --> 01:08:29,145
Go, go, go!

850
01:08:29,262 --> 01:08:32,815
Seven years per hour here.
Let's make it count!

851
01:08:58,824 --> 01:09:00,176
This way.

852
01:09:02,912 --> 01:09:04,764
About 200 meters.

853
01:09:14,173 --> 01:09:16,300
The gravity's punishing.

854
01:09:16,759 --> 01:09:18,953
Been floating through space too long?

855
01:09:19,053 --> 01:09:21,330
110% Earth gravity.

856
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:23,732
Come on. Come on.

857
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:28,996
- There's nothing here.
- Should be right here.

858
01:09:30,815 --> 01:09:34,118
If the signal's
coming from here, then...

859
01:09:43,452 --> 01:09:45,120
Her beacon.

860
01:09:52,753 --> 01:09:53,896
Wreckage.

861
01:09:54,463 --> 01:09:55,731
Where's the rest?

862
01:09:56,132 --> 01:09:57,733
Towards the mountains!

863
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:03,405
Those aren't mountains.

864
01:10:04,974 --> 01:10:06,408
They're waves.

865
01:10:11,647 --> 01:10:14,416
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

866
01:10:14,817 --> 01:10:16,919
That one's moving away from us.

867
01:10:23,325 --> 01:10:25,094
We need the recorder.

868
01:10:35,171 --> 01:10:37,490
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

869
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:41,035
We're not leaving without her data.

870
01:10:41,135 --> 01:10:44,413
Get back here now! We do not have time!

871
01:10:44,513 --> 01:10:47,074
The second wave is coming!
We're in the middle of a swell.

872
01:10:48,267 --> 01:10:49,752
No, I got it.

873
01:10:49,852 --> 01:10:51,954
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

874
01:10:56,859 --> 01:10:59,003
Brand, get back here now!

875
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:03,173
No, Cooper, go.
Cooper, go. I can't make it.

876
01:11:03,491 --> 01:11:05,968
- Go!
- CASE, go get her.

877
01:11:10,664 --> 01:11:12,766
- Go!
- Get up. Get up, Brand!

878
01:11:13,584 --> 01:11:15,185
Go, go! Go!

879
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:19,607
- I'm not gonna make it!
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!

880
01:11:26,347 --> 01:11:28,741
Come on, CASE has her!
Get back here, Doyle!

881
01:11:31,644 --> 01:11:33,028
Come on!

882
01:11:35,481 --> 01:11:36,999
Get to the hatch!

883
01:11:41,445 --> 01:11:43,047
Go, go! Go!

884
01:11:48,494 --> 01:11:49,678
Shit.

885
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:52,014
Manually overriding inside hatch!

886
01:11:55,417 --> 01:11:56,685
Cooper! Wait!

887
01:12:03,926 --> 01:12:07,696
The engines are flooded!
I'm gonna have to shut her down.

888
01:12:41,046 --> 01:12:42,481
Holy shit.

889
01:12:46,802 --> 01:12:48,237
Hang on!

890
01:13:19,376 --> 01:13:23,313
- CASE, what's the problem?
- Too waterlogged. Let it drain.

891
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:25,616
Goddamn it!

892
01:13:25,716 --> 01:13:30,454
- I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?
- And I told you to get your ass back here!

893
01:13:30,554 --> 01:13:35,325
- One of us was thinking about the mission!
- You were thinking about getting home.

894
01:13:37,061 --> 01:13:39,463
I was trying to do the right thing!

895
01:13:39,563 --> 01:13:41,623
Can you tell that to Doyle?

896
01:13:43,617 --> 01:13:46,086
- CASE, how much time?
- Forty-five to an hour.

897
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:51,568
The stuff of life?
What's this gonna cost us, Brand?

898
01:13:52,368 --> 01:13:54,395
A lot. Decades.

899
01:14:01,543 --> 01:14:02,978
What happened to Miller?

900
01:14:03,629 --> 01:14:09,243
Judging by the wreckage, she was
broken up by a wave soon after impact.

901
01:14:09,343 --> 01:14:12,279
How's the wreckage stayed together
after all these years?

902
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:15,732
Because of the time slippage.

903
01:14:16,558 --> 01:14:21,163
On this planet's time,
she just landed hours ago.

904
01:14:21,981 --> 01:14:24,425
She probably just died minutes ago.

905
01:14:24,525 --> 01:14:28,670
The data Doyle received was just
the initial status echoing endlessly.

906
01:14:28,946 --> 01:14:31,215
Oh, we are not prepared for this.

907
01:14:33,492 --> 01:14:37,021
You eggheads have the survival skills
of a Boy Scout troop.

908
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:40,441
Well, we got this far on our brains.
Farther than any human in history.

909
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:42,359
Well, not far enough!

910
01:14:42,459 --> 01:14:46,063
And now we're stuck here till there
won't be anyone left on Earth to save.

911
01:14:49,008 --> 01:14:51,777
I'm counting every minute,
same as you, Cooper.

912
01:14:56,473 --> 01:14:58,375
Is there any possibility...

913
01:14:58,475 --> 01:15:02,171
I don't know, some kind of a way
we can maybe all jump in a black hole?

914
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,039
Gain back the years?

915
01:15:04,606 --> 01:15:06,175
Don't shake your head at me.

916
01:15:06,275 --> 01:15:08,344
Time is relative, okay?

917
01:15:08,444 --> 01:15:11,588
It can stretch
and it can squeeze, but...

918
01:15:11,989 --> 01:15:14,266
it can't run backwards. It just can't.

919
01:15:14,366 --> 01:15:18,887
The only thing that can move across
dimensions, like time, is gravity.

920
01:15:21,498 --> 01:15:22,966
Okay.

921
01:15:24,626 --> 01:15:28,572
The beings that led us here,
they communicate...

922
01:15:28,672 --> 01:15:30,574
- ...through gravity, right?
- Yes.

923
01:15:30,674 --> 01:15:32,943
Could they be talking to us
from the future?

924
01:15:33,761 --> 01:15:36,113
- Maybe.
- Okay. If they can...

925
01:15:37,222 --> 01:15:40,576
"They" are beings of five dimensions.

926
01:15:40,893 --> 01:15:44,329
To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

927
01:15:44,563 --> 01:15:45,998
To them...

928
01:15:46,315 --> 01:15:50,552
the past might be a canyon
that they can climb into and the future...

929
01:15:50,652 --> 01:15:53,755
a mountain they can climb up.
But to us, it's not, okay?

930
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:58,259
Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

931
01:15:59,328 --> 01:16:02,681
- But you knew about relativity.
- Oh.

932
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:05,959
Brand...

933
01:16:10,339 --> 01:16:12,558
my daughter was 10 years old.

934
01:16:12,883 --> 01:16:15,777
I couldn't teach her
Einstein's theories before I left.

935
01:16:16,095 --> 01:16:19,031
Couldn't you have told her
you were going to save the world?

936
01:16:19,515 --> 01:16:21,057
No.

937
01:16:22,226 --> 01:16:26,696
When you become a parent,
one thing becomes really clear.

938
01:16:27,898 --> 01:16:31,168
And that is that you want to make sure
your children feel safe.

939
01:16:32,111 --> 01:16:36,264
And it rules out telling a 10-year-old
that the world is ending.

940
01:16:38,225 --> 01:16:39,801
Cooper?

941
01:16:43,413 --> 01:16:45,983
- How long for the engines, CASE?
- A minute or two.

942
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:48,268
We don't have it. Helmets on!

943
01:16:52,089 --> 01:16:53,949
Brand, co-pilot, you're up.

944
01:16:54,049 --> 01:16:56,618
CASE, blow the cabin oxygen
through the main thrusters!

945
01:16:56,718 --> 01:16:58,528
- We're gonna spark it.
- Roger that.

946
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,155
- Locked.
- Depressurizing.

947
01:17:05,936 --> 01:17:07,287
Engines up!

948
01:17:36,049 --> 01:17:37,651
Hello, Rom.

949
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:39,978
I've waited years.

950
01:17:40,762 --> 01:17:43,298
How...? How many years?

951
01:17:44,433 --> 01:17:47,461
- By now it must be...
- Twenty-three years...

952
01:17:47,561 --> 01:17:49,571
four months, eight days.

953
01:17:53,692 --> 01:17:55,360
Doyle?

954
01:18:01,074 --> 01:18:04,277
I thought I was prepared.
I knew the theory.

955
01:18:05,454 --> 01:18:07,055
Reality's different.

956
01:18:07,998 --> 01:18:09,767
And Miller?

957
01:18:10,751 --> 01:18:12,853
There's nothing here for us.

958
01:18:15,605 --> 01:18:17,107
Why didn't you sleep?

959
01:18:17,966 --> 01:18:22,154
Oh, I had a couple of stretches.
But I stopped believing you were coming back.

960
01:18:22,554 --> 01:18:25,657
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

961
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:29,328
I learned what I could
from the black hole...

962
01:18:29,603 --> 01:18:32,131
but I couldn't send anything
to your father.

963
01:18:32,231 --> 01:18:34,550
We've been receiving,
but nothing gets out.

964
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:37,035
- Is he alive?
- Oh, yeah.

965
01:18:37,152 --> 01:18:39,346
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

966
01:18:41,949 --> 01:18:45,052
We've got years of messages stored.

967
01:18:45,244 --> 01:18:46,478
Cooper.

968
01:18:46,578 --> 01:18:49,881
Messages span 23 years.

969
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:53,393
Play it from the beginning.

970
01:18:56,338 --> 01:18:58,348
Hey, Dad.

971
01:18:58,882 --> 01:19:01,601
Checking in. Saying hi.

972
01:19:04,054 --> 01:19:06,147
Finished second in school.

973
01:19:07,432 --> 01:19:10,043
Miss Kurling's still
giving me C's though.

974
01:19:10,143 --> 01:19:13,280
Pulled me down, but seconds not bad.

975
01:19:14,147 --> 01:19:16,716
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

976
01:19:17,943 --> 01:19:20,045
Oh.

977
01:19:20,904 --> 01:19:22,931
I met another girl, Dad.

978
01:19:23,031 --> 01:19:24,916
I...

979
01:19:25,367 --> 01:19:27,669
I really think this is the one.

980
01:19:28,662 --> 01:19:31,948
Name's Lois. That's her right there.

981
01:19:34,293 --> 01:19:36,795
Murphy stole Grandpa's car.

982
01:19:36,962 --> 01:19:40,031
She crashed it. She's okay, though.

983
01:19:40,299 --> 01:19:41,783
Hey, Dad.

984
01:19:42,301 --> 01:19:43,935
Look at this!

985
01:19:44,469 --> 01:19:46,271
You're a grandpa.

986
01:19:47,389 --> 01:19:49,357
His name's Jesse.

987
01:19:49,725 --> 01:19:54,880
I kind of wanted to call him Coop,
but Lois says... maybe next time.

988
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:59,501
Donald says he's already earned
the "great" part, so we just leave it at that.

989
01:20:02,571 --> 01:20:04,464
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

990
01:20:05,157 --> 01:20:09,094
Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."
Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.

991
01:20:09,411 --> 01:20:12,013
Sorry it's been a while.

992
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:14,933
Just...

993
01:20:16,543 --> 01:20:18,945
what with Jesse and all.

994
01:20:25,052 --> 01:20:27,687
Grandpa died last week.

995
01:20:27,804 --> 01:20:31,391
We buried him out in the back forty
next to Mom and...

996
01:20:31,767 --> 01:20:33,451
Jesse.

997
01:20:33,727 --> 01:20:37,313
Which is where we would have buried you
if you'd ever...

998
01:20:37,564 --> 01:20:39,666
come back.

999
01:20:40,567 --> 01:20:43,119
Murph was there at the funeral.

1000
01:20:43,445 --> 01:20:46,398
We don't see her that much,
but she came for that.

1001
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:52,428
You aren't listening to this,
I know that.

1002
01:20:54,956 --> 01:20:57,809
All these messages are just, like...

1003
01:20:58,877 --> 01:21:03,047
drifting out there in the darkness.

1004
01:21:03,632 --> 01:21:06,067
Lois says that...

1005
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:09,788
I have to let you go.

1006
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,823
And...

1007
01:21:12,224 --> 01:21:13,908
So...

1008
01:21:16,561 --> 01:21:19,848
I guess I'm letting you go.

1009
01:21:20,607 --> 01:21:23,776
I don't know where you are, Dad...

1010
01:21:23,902 --> 01:21:26,830
but I hope that you're at peace.

1011
01:21:28,323 --> 01:21:29,708
Goodbye.

1012
01:21:43,004 --> 01:21:44,656
Hey, Dad.

1013
01:21:47,092 --> 01:21:48,327
Hey, Murph.

1014
01:21:48,427 --> 01:21:50,845
You son of a bitch.

1015
01:21:54,057 --> 01:21:56,626
I never made one of these
when you were still responding...

1016
01:21:56,726 --> 01:21:59,362
because I was so mad at you for leaving.

1017
01:22:02,107 --> 01:22:04,592
And then when you went quiet, it...

1018
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:10,256
seemed like I should live with that decision.
And I have.

1019
01:22:14,161 --> 01:22:16,880
But today's my birthday.

1020
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:23,920
And it's a special one,
because you told me...

1021
01:22:27,549 --> 01:22:32,187
You once told me that when you came back,
we might be the same age.

1022
01:22:33,597 --> 01:22:36,983
And today I'm the age you were
when you left.

1023
01:22:39,686 --> 01:22:41,838
So it would be a real good time
for you to come back.

1024
01:22:56,244 --> 01:23:00,640
I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that
I've never seen you in here before.

1025
01:23:01,166 --> 01:23:03,435
I've never been in here before.

1026
01:23:05,212 --> 01:23:10,450
I talk to Amelia all the time. It helps.

1027
01:23:10,717 --> 01:23:13,537
- I'm glad you've started.
- I haven't. I...

1028
01:23:13,637 --> 01:23:16,239
I just had something
I needed to get out.

1029
01:23:16,473 --> 01:23:18,959
- I know they're still out there.
- I know.

1030
01:23:19,059 --> 01:23:23,338
There are so many reasons their
communications might not be getting through.

1031
01:23:23,438 --> 01:23:24,956
I know, professor.

1032
01:23:25,482 --> 01:23:28,501
I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.

1033
01:23:29,569 --> 01:23:32,405
Them never coming back or...

1034
01:23:33,114 --> 01:23:36,393
coming back to find we've failed.

1035
01:23:36,493 --> 01:23:38,011
Then let's succeed.

1036
01:23:38,954 --> 01:23:40,496
So...

1037
01:23:40,705 --> 01:23:44,943
back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

1038
01:23:45,043 --> 01:23:48,447
With respect, professor,
we've tried that hundreds of times.

1039
01:23:48,547 --> 01:23:52,717
It only has to work once, Murph.

1040
01:23:55,512 --> 01:23:59,458
Every rivet that they strike
could have been a bullet.

1041
01:23:59,558 --> 01:24:01,626
We've done well for the world here...

1042
01:24:01,726 --> 01:24:06,548
whether or not we crack the equation
before I kick the bucket.

1043
01:24:06,648 --> 01:24:09,626
- Don't be morbid, professor.
- I'm not afraid of death.

1044
01:24:10,277 --> 01:24:12,612
I'm an old physicist.

1045
01:24:13,363 --> 01:24:15,131
I'm afraid of time.

1046
01:24:22,205 --> 01:24:23,473
Time.

1047
01:24:25,417 --> 01:24:27,185
You're afraid of time.

1048
01:24:29,671 --> 01:24:31,740
We've been trying
to solve the equation...

1049
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,409
without changing
the underlying assumption about time.

1050
01:24:34,509 --> 01:24:36,286
- And?
- And that means...

1051
01:24:36,386 --> 01:24:40,916
each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

1052
01:24:41,016 --> 01:24:43,335
It's recursive. It's nonsensical.

1053
01:24:43,435 --> 01:24:47,297
Are you calling my life's work...
nonsense, Murph?

1054
01:24:47,397 --> 01:24:49,308
No, I'm saying
that you've been trying to...

1055
01:24:49,408 --> 01:24:53,703
finish it with one arm...
No, with both arms tied behind your back.

1056
01:24:55,488 --> 01:24:57,890
And I don't understand why.

1057
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:00,685
I'm an old man, Murph.

1058
01:25:01,202 --> 01:25:03,897
Can we take this point up
at another time?

1059
01:25:03,997 --> 01:25:06,424
I want to talk to my daughter.

1060
01:25:08,293 --> 01:25:10,820
Stepping out into the universe...

1061
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:14,816
we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.

1062
01:25:15,634 --> 01:25:20,247
We must reach far beyond
our own lifespans.

1063
01:25:20,347 --> 01:25:25,877
We must think not as individuals
but as a species.

1064
01:25:28,313 --> 01:25:31,640
Do not go gentle into that good night

1065
01:25:33,109 --> 01:25:35,762
TARS kept the Endurance
right where we needed her.

1066
01:25:35,862 --> 01:25:38,757
But the trip took years longer
than we anticipated.

1067
01:25:38,990 --> 01:25:42,594
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects, so...

1068
01:25:42,827 --> 01:25:44,629
we have to choose.

1069
01:25:45,538 --> 01:25:46,965
But how?

1070
01:25:47,707 --> 01:25:49,676
They're both promising.

1071
01:25:50,919 --> 01:25:55,490
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann
is the one still transmitting, so...

1072
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:58,810
We've no reason to suspect
Edmunds's data would have soured.

1073
01:25:59,427 --> 01:26:01,997
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

1074
01:26:02,097 --> 01:26:05,566
- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.

1075
01:26:06,434 --> 01:26:07,777
And...

1076
01:26:08,269 --> 01:26:10,505
I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

1077
01:26:10,605 --> 01:26:14,242
- Why?
- Gargantua, that's why.

1078
01:26:15,068 --> 01:26:19,180
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

1079
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:24,002
but no life. Sterile.
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.

1080
01:26:24,119 --> 01:26:25,979
Because of the black hole?

1081
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:29,190
Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen will happen.

1082
01:26:29,290 --> 01:26:31,693
Accident is the first building block
of evolution.

1083
01:26:31,793 --> 01:26:34,696
But when you're orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen.

1084
01:26:34,796 --> 01:26:39,367
It sucks in asteroids and comets,
other events which would otherwise reach you.

1085
01:26:39,467 --> 01:26:41,602
We need to go further afield.

1086
01:26:41,928 --> 01:26:44,564
You once said that Dr. Mann...

1087
01:26:45,515 --> 01:26:47,208
was the best of us.

1088
01:26:47,308 --> 01:26:50,778
He's remarkable.
We're only here because of him.

1089
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:52,922
And yet... Yet here he is.

1090
01:26:53,022 --> 01:26:57,308
He's on the ground, and he's sending
a very unambiguous message,

1091
01:26:57,408 --> 01:26:59,929
telling us to come to his planet.

1092
01:27:00,029 --> 01:27:04,959
Granted, but Edmunds' data
is more promising.

1093
01:27:05,118 --> 01:27:06,227
We should vote.

1094
01:27:06,327 --> 01:27:08,796
Well, if we vote,
there's something you should know.

1095
01:27:09,622 --> 01:27:12,800
Brand? He has a right to know.

1096
01:27:13,001 --> 01:27:14,819
That has nothing to do with it.

1097
01:27:14,919 --> 01:27:18,031
- What does?
- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.

1098
01:27:18,131 --> 01:27:21,175
- Is that true?
- Yes.

1099
01:27:23,845 --> 01:27:26,856
And that makes me
want to follow my heart.

1100
01:27:30,018 --> 01:27:33,755
But maybe we've spent too long trying
to figure all this out with theory.

1101
01:27:33,855 --> 01:27:35,340
You're a scientist, Brand.

1102
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,283
So listen to me...

1103
01:27:37,817 --> 01:27:42,830
when I say that love
isn't something we invented. It's...

1104
01:27:43,531 --> 01:27:46,167
observable, powerful.

1105
01:27:47,952 --> 01:27:49,629
It has to mean something.

1106
01:27:49,729 --> 01:27:54,075
Love has meaning, yes. Social utility,
social bonding, child rearing...

1107
01:27:54,175 --> 01:27:57,979
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?

1108
01:27:58,421 --> 01:27:59,531
None.

1109
01:27:59,631 --> 01:28:03,576
Maybe it means something more,
something we can't...

1110
01:28:03,676 --> 01:28:05,787
yet understand.

1111
01:28:05,887 --> 01:28:09,649
Maybe it's some evidence, some...

1112
01:28:10,308 --> 01:28:14,838
artifact of a higher dimension
that we can't consciously perceive.

1113
01:28:14,938 --> 01:28:19,801
I'm drawn across the universe
to someone I haven't seen in a decade...

1114
01:28:19,901 --> 01:28:22,971
who I know is probably dead.

1115
01:28:23,071 --> 01:28:26,474
Love is the one thing
we're capable of perceiving...

1116
01:28:26,574 --> 01:28:29,710
that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

1117
01:28:31,246 --> 01:28:35,883
Maybe we should trust that,
even if we can't understand it yet.

1118
01:28:40,588 --> 01:28:42,557
All right, Cooper...

1119
01:28:44,133 --> 01:28:45,726
yes...

1120
01:28:46,594 --> 01:28:50,131
the tiniest possibility
of seeing Wolf again excites me.

1121
01:28:50,765 --> 01:28:52,733
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

1122
01:28:53,142 --> 01:28:55,611
Honestly, Amelia...

1123
01:28:57,105 --> 01:28:58,373
it might.

1124
01:29:05,071 --> 01:29:08,082
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

1125
01:29:24,874 --> 01:29:28,144
We'll lose about a third again.
But next year...

1126
01:29:30,138 --> 01:29:33,074
Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm
and we'll make it up.

1127
01:29:33,808 --> 01:29:35,943
What happened to Nelson?

1128
01:29:41,566 --> 01:29:43,843
Murph, have you eaten enough?
Would you like some more souffle?

1129
01:29:43,943 --> 01:29:47,622
Oh, no. I'm full, thanks.
It was delicious.

1130
01:29:48,197 --> 01:29:50,499
Coop, finish your fritter, please.

1131
01:29:52,368 --> 01:29:56,147
Will you spend the night? Your room
is exactly as you left it. It's ready.

1132
01:29:56,247 --> 01:29:57,690
I need to get back.

1133
01:29:57,790 --> 01:29:59,601
My sewing machine is in there,
but there's plenty...

1134
01:29:59,701 --> 01:30:02,094
I need to...

1135
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,715
Too many memories.

1136
01:30:06,841 --> 01:30:09,736
We might have something for that.
Hey, Coop.

1137
01:30:17,185 --> 01:30:18,578
The dust.

1138
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:23,424
Lois, I have a friend who...

1139
01:30:23,824 --> 01:30:25,660
could look at his lungs.

1140
01:30:43,544 --> 01:30:46,281
- Amelia, I'm sorry.
- You were just being objective.

1141
01:30:46,381 --> 01:30:49,909
Unless you're punishing me
for screwing up on Miller's planet.

1142
01:30:50,009 --> 01:30:52,561
No, this wasn't a personal decision.

1143
01:30:53,096 --> 01:30:57,208
If you're wrong, you will have
a very personal decision to make.

1144
01:30:57,308 --> 01:31:00,503
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

1145
01:31:00,603 --> 01:31:04,674
Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have
to decide whether to return home...

1146
01:31:04,774 --> 01:31:07,135
or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.

1147
01:31:07,235 --> 01:31:11,139
Starting a colony could save us
from extinction.

1148
01:31:11,239 --> 01:31:14,475
You might have to decide
between seeing your children again...

1149
01:31:14,575 --> 01:31:16,511
and the future of the human race.

1150
01:31:17,712 --> 01:31:19,722
I trust you'll be as objective then.

1151
01:31:26,504 --> 01:31:28,489
He's been asking for you
since he came to.

1152
01:31:28,589 --> 01:31:30,316
We were trying to reach you.

1153
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:37,523
Murph.

1154
01:31:38,224 --> 01:31:40,026
I'm here, professor.

1155
01:31:40,435 --> 01:31:42,804
I let you all down.

1156
01:31:43,104 --> 01:31:46,741
No, you got us so far. Real close.

1157
01:31:48,276 --> 01:31:50,136
I'll finish what you started.

1158
01:31:50,236 --> 01:31:52,747
Good, good Murph.

1159
01:31:54,741 --> 01:31:57,335
You had faith...

1160
01:31:58,244 --> 01:31:59,837
all those...

1161
01:32:00,496 --> 01:32:02,590
all those years.

1162
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:05,276
I...

1163
01:32:05,376 --> 01:32:08,179
I asked you to have faith.

1164
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:12,725
I wanted you to believe...

1165
01:32:13,926 --> 01:32:16,103
that your father...

1166
01:32:18,806 --> 01:32:20,708
would come back.

1167
01:32:20,808 --> 01:32:22,101
I do, professor.

1168
01:32:23,728 --> 01:32:27,982
- Forgive me, Murph.
- There's nothing to forgive.

1169
01:32:31,051 --> 01:32:34,413
I... I lied, Murph.

1170
01:32:36,491 --> 01:32:38,584
I lied to you.

1171
01:32:44,624 --> 01:32:47,935
There was no need for him to...

1172
01:32:49,045 --> 01:32:51,222
To come back.

1173
01:32:53,508 --> 01:32:57,144
There is no way to help us.

1174
01:32:58,137 --> 01:32:59,480
But Plan A...

1175
01:32:59,722 --> 01:33:03,150
All this. All these people.

1176
01:33:03,976 --> 01:33:06,071
And the equation.

1177
01:33:09,774 --> 01:33:11,626
Did my father know?

1178
01:33:15,321 --> 01:33:17,531
Did he leave me?

1179
01:33:20,993 --> 01:33:22,336
Do...

1180
01:33:23,204 --> 01:33:24,839
not...

1181
01:33:25,498 --> 01:33:27,049
go...

1182
01:33:27,959 --> 01:33:30,044
gentle...

1183
01:33:31,546 --> 01:33:33,013
No.

1184
01:33:34,382 --> 01:33:35,966
No!

1185
01:33:36,676 --> 01:33:38,619
You can't leave.

1186
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:40,271
You... No.

1187
01:33:41,055 --> 01:33:46,026
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today. He had no pain.

1188
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:48,379
He was at peace.

1189
01:33:48,646 --> 01:33:51,031
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1190
01:34:03,327 --> 01:34:05,096
Brand, did you know?

1191
01:34:07,415 --> 01:34:09,383
He told you, right?

1192
01:34:11,961 --> 01:34:13,837
You knew.

1193
01:34:15,256 --> 01:34:17,349
This was all a sham.

1194
01:34:21,429 --> 01:34:23,614
You left us here.

1195
01:34:25,266 --> 01:34:27,067
To suffocate.

1196
01:34:28,936 --> 01:34:30,571
To starve.

1197
01:34:57,632 --> 01:34:59,066
Frozen cloud.

1198
01:37:23,402 --> 01:37:26,664
It's okay. It's okay.

1199
01:37:33,204 --> 01:37:35,005
It's okay.

1200
01:37:40,127 --> 01:37:42,429
Pray you never learn...

1201
01:37:43,297 --> 01:37:46,934
just how good it can be
to see another face.

1202
01:37:55,059 --> 01:37:57,628
I hadn't a lot of hope
to begin with, but...

1203
01:37:57,728 --> 01:38:00,364
after so long, I had none.

1204
01:38:01,532 --> 01:38:04,868
My supplies were completely exhausted.

1205
01:38:06,529 --> 01:38:10,582
The last time I went to sleep,
I didn't even set a waking date.

1206
01:38:13,994 --> 01:38:16,880
You have literally raised me
from the dead.

1207
01:38:17,623 --> 01:38:19,873
Lazarus.

1208
01:38:20,709 --> 01:38:24,263
- What about the others?
- I'm afraid you're it, sir.

1209
01:38:24,672 --> 01:38:27,391
So far, surely.

1210
01:38:27,842 --> 01:38:32,780
No, our present situation is that there's
very little chance of rescuing any others.

1211
01:38:36,434 --> 01:38:38,944
Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?

1212
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,413
Tell us about your world.

1213
01:38:44,692 --> 01:38:46,635
Our world, we hope.

1214
01:38:50,364 --> 01:38:52,767
Our world... is cold...

1215
01:38:52,867 --> 01:38:54,660
stark...

1216
01:38:56,036 --> 01:38:58,172
but undeniably beautiful.

1217
01:39:00,124 --> 01:39:03,677
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

1218
01:39:07,581 --> 01:39:09,200
The nights are...

1219
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:12,135
67 far colder hours.

1220
01:39:17,475 --> 01:39:21,879
The gravity is a very, very pleasant
80 percent of the Earth's.

1221
01:39:21,979 --> 01:39:25,216
Now, up here where I landed,
the water is alkali...

1222
01:39:25,316 --> 01:39:29,136
and the air has too much ammonia to breathe
for more than just a few minutes...

1223
01:39:29,236 --> 01:39:33,891
but down at the surface,
and there is a surface...

1224
01:39:33,991 --> 01:39:35,683
the chlorine dissipates.

1225
01:39:35,784 --> 01:39:39,897
The ammonia gives way to crystalline
hydrocarbons and breathable air.

1226
01:39:39,997 --> 01:39:44,268
To organics. Possibly even to life.

1227
01:39:45,002 --> 01:39:47,221
We might be sharing this world.

1228
01:39:47,463 --> 01:39:49,290
These readings are from the surface?

1229
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:52,993
Over the years,
I've dropped various probes.

1230
01:39:53,093 --> 01:39:56,580
- How far have you explored?
- I've mounted several major expeditions.

1231
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:00,801
But with oxygen in limited supply,
KIPP there really did most of the legwork.

1232
01:40:00,901 --> 01:40:03,629
- What went wrong with him, sir?
- Degeneration.

1233
01:40:03,729 --> 01:40:07,383
He misidentified the first organics
we found as ammonia crystals.

1234
01:40:07,483 --> 01:40:11,679
We struggled on for a time,
but ultimately I decommissioned him and...

1235
01:40:11,779 --> 01:40:14,014
used his power source
to keep the mission going.

1236
01:40:14,114 --> 01:40:17,184
I thought I was alone
before I shut him down.

1237
01:40:17,284 --> 01:40:19,253
Would you like me to look at him?

1238
01:40:19,453 --> 01:40:21,689
No. No. He needs a human touch.

1239
01:40:21,789 --> 01:40:26,360
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message
for you from the comm station.

1240
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:29,221
Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.

1241
01:40:40,933 --> 01:40:43,619
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1242
01:40:44,228 --> 01:40:46,354
He had no pain.

1243
01:40:48,983 --> 01:40:50,784
He was at peace.

1244
01:40:52,570 --> 01:40:54,705
I'm sorry for your loss.

1245
01:40:56,782 --> 01:40:58,125
Is that Murph?

1246
01:40:58,534 --> 01:41:01,061
She's... She's grown.

1247
01:41:01,161 --> 01:41:03,246
Brand, did you know?

1248
01:41:03,914 --> 01:41:06,083
He told you, right?

1249
01:41:08,627 --> 01:41:10,220
You knew.

1250
01:41:11,672 --> 01:41:13,273
This was all a sham.

1251
01:41:14,216 --> 01:41:16,384
You left us here.

1252
01:41:18,012 --> 01:41:19,813
To suffocate.

1253
01:41:21,599 --> 01:41:23,275
To starve.

1254
01:41:26,312 --> 01:41:28,096
Did my father know too?

1255
01:41:30,482 --> 01:41:32,242
Dad?

1256
01:41:33,694 --> 01:41:35,913
I just want to know...

1257
01:41:36,947 --> 01:41:39,149
if you left me here to die.

1258
01:41:41,535 --> 01:41:43,837
I just have to know.

1259
01:41:49,043 --> 01:41:50,761
Cooper, my...

1260
01:41:51,962 --> 01:41:54,156
My father dedicated...

1261
01:41:54,256 --> 01:41:59,761
his whole life to Plan A.
I have no idea what she's talking about.

1262
01:42:01,071 --> 01:42:02,639
I do.

1263
01:42:07,269 --> 01:42:10,238
He never even hoped
to get the people off the Earth?

1264
01:42:11,148 --> 01:42:12,658
No.

1265
01:42:16,403 --> 01:42:20,540
But he's been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1266
01:42:20,741 --> 01:42:24,461
Amelia, your father solved his equation
before I even left.

1267
01:42:24,745 --> 01:42:26,689
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1268
01:42:26,789 --> 01:42:30,818
The equation couldn't reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics. You need more.

1269
01:42:30,918 --> 01:42:32,903
More? More what?

1270
01:42:33,003 --> 01:42:36,073
More data.
You need to see into a black hole.

1271
01:42:36,173 --> 01:42:38,325
The laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity.

1272
01:42:38,425 --> 01:42:40,227
Romilly, is that true?

1273
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:44,999
If a black hole is an oyster,
then the singularity's the pearl inside.

1274
01:42:45,099 --> 01:42:49,936
The gravity's so strong, it's always
hidden in darkness... behind the horizon.

1275
01:42:50,854 --> 01:42:53,007
That's why we call it a black hole.

1276
01:42:53,107 --> 01:42:56,827
Okay, but if we see
beyond the horizon...

1277
01:42:57,111 --> 01:42:58,679
We can't, Coop.

1278
01:42:58,779 --> 01:43:01,515
There are some things
that aren't meant to be known.

1279
01:43:01,615 --> 01:43:05,728
Your father had to find another way
to save the human race from extinction.

1280
01:43:05,828 --> 01:43:09,464
- Plan B. A colony.
- Why not tell people?

1281
01:43:10,749 --> 01:43:13,902
- Why keep building those stations?
- He knew how hard it would be...

1282
01:43:14,002 --> 01:43:18,198
to get people to work together to save
the species instead of themselves.

1283
01:43:18,498 --> 01:43:20,743
- Or their children.
- Bullshit.

1284
01:43:20,843 --> 01:43:23,704
You never would've come here
unless you believed you would save them.

1285
01:43:23,804 --> 01:43:26,682
Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

1286
01:43:26,782 --> 01:43:30,674
We can care deeply,
selflessly about those we know,

1287
01:43:30,774 --> 01:43:33,380
but that empathy rarely extends
beyond our line of sight.

1288
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:35,490
But the lie.

1289
01:43:38,485 --> 01:43:41,104
That monstrous lie?

1290
01:43:42,156 --> 01:43:45,375
Unforgivable. And he knew that.

1291
01:43:45,826 --> 01:43:50,230
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity
in order to save the species.

1292
01:43:50,330 --> 01:43:53,050
- He made an incredible sacrifice.
- No.

1293
01:43:54,168 --> 01:43:59,147
An incredible sacrifice is being made
by the people on Earth who are gonna die!

1294
01:43:59,506 --> 01:44:01,775
Because in his fucking arrogance...

1295
01:44:02,092 --> 01:44:04,278
he declared their case hopeless.

1296
01:44:04,845 --> 01:44:08,415
I'm sorry, Cooper...
their case is hopeless.

1297
01:44:08,515 --> 01:44:10,942
No. No.

1298
01:44:11,268 --> 01:44:12,870
We are the future.

1299
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:18,658
Cooper, what can I do?

1300
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:23,505
Let me go home.

1301
01:44:23,989 --> 01:44:26,008
You're absolutely positive?

1302
01:44:26,533 --> 01:44:29,136
His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.

1303
01:44:29,703 --> 01:44:32,431
- It's worthless?
- It's half the answer.

1304
01:44:33,290 --> 01:44:36,393
Okay, how do you find the other half?

1305
01:44:36,877 --> 01:44:38,612
Out there? A black hole.

1306
01:44:38,712 --> 01:44:41,848
- But stuck down here on Earth?
- Yeah?

1307
01:44:42,883 --> 01:44:44,851
I'm not sure you can.

1308
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:49,439
God, they just pack up and leave.

1309
01:44:50,557 --> 01:44:52,943
What are they hoping to find?

1310
01:44:53,227 --> 01:44:54,569
Survival.

1311
01:45:02,069 --> 01:45:03,453
Damn it.

1312
01:45:06,073 --> 01:45:09,968
Murph, don't...?
Don't people have a right to know?

1313
01:45:10,494 --> 01:45:14,648
Panic won't help. We just
have to keep working, same as ever.

1314
01:45:14,748 --> 01:45:18,152
But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand
was manipulating us to do?

1315
01:45:18,252 --> 01:45:21,605
Brand gave up on us.
I'm still trying to solve this.

1316
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:23,715
So...

1317
01:45:24,633 --> 01:45:26,602
do you have an idea?

1318
01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:28,645
A feeling.

1319
01:45:31,765 --> 01:45:34,067
I told you about my ghost.

1320
01:45:35,769 --> 01:45:38,072
My dad thought I called it a ghost...

1321
01:45:38,172 --> 01:45:40,240
because I was scared of it.

1322
01:45:43,402 --> 01:45:45,735
But I was never scared of it.

1323
01:45:46,947 --> 01:45:49,916
I called it a ghost because it felt...

1324
01:45:52,035 --> 01:45:54,004
It felt like a person.

1325
01:45:56,248 --> 01:45:58,216
It was trying to tell me something.

1326
01:46:00,878 --> 01:46:03,981
If there's an answer here on Earth,
it's back there...

1327
01:46:04,339 --> 01:46:08,852
somehow, in that room.
So I have to find it.

1328
01:46:11,972 --> 01:46:14,024
We're running out of time.

1329
01:46:15,642 --> 01:46:17,711
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

1330
01:46:17,811 --> 01:46:20,047
No, they can stay.
I'll be sleeping anyway.

1331
01:46:20,147 --> 01:46:21,799
- Hey, Coop?
- Yeah?

1332
01:46:21,899 --> 01:46:23,967
I have a suggestion
for your return journey.

1333
01:46:24,067 --> 01:46:26,920
- Yeah, what's that?
- Have one last crack at the black hole.

1334
01:46:28,697 --> 01:46:30,149
I'm going home, Rom.

1335
01:46:30,249 --> 01:46:34,002
Yeah, I know.
This isn't going to cost you any time.

1336
01:46:34,453 --> 01:46:36,488
There's a chance for the people on Earth.

1337
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:40,150
- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

1338
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:44,196
- It's what we call a gentle singularity.
- Gentle?

1339
01:46:44,296 --> 01:46:47,825
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that...

1340
01:46:47,925 --> 01:46:52,246
something crossing the horizon fast
might survive. A probe, say.

1341
01:46:52,346 --> 01:46:57,084
- What happens after it crosses?
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.

1342
01:46:57,184 --> 01:47:00,337
So, what's to say
there isn't some way that the probe...

1343
01:47:00,437 --> 01:47:03,423
can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1344
01:47:03,523 --> 01:47:06,844
If he's equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse.

1345
01:47:06,944 --> 01:47:10,038
Just when did this probe
become a "he," professor?

1346
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:12,332
TARS is the obvious candidate.

1347
01:47:12,866 --> 01:47:14,852
I've already told him what to look for.

1348
01:47:14,952 --> 01:47:17,729
I'd need the old optical transmitter
off KIPP, Cooper.

1349
01:47:17,829 --> 01:47:19,231
You'd do this for us?

1350
01:47:19,331 --> 01:47:23,552
Before you get all teary, remember that
as a robot I have to do anything you say.

1351
01:47:24,169 --> 01:47:27,639
- Your cue light's broken.
- I'm not joking.

1352
01:47:29,967 --> 01:47:33,287
I'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1353
01:47:33,387 --> 01:47:35,789
I don't want to disturb
his archival functions.

1354
01:47:35,889 --> 01:47:37,624
I'll supervise.

1355
01:47:37,724 --> 01:47:38,834
All right.

1356
01:47:38,934 --> 01:47:43,672
Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure sites.
One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.

1357
01:47:43,772 --> 01:47:46,300
Once those modules have landed,
you don't want to move them.

1358
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:49,011
I can take you to the probe sites,
but I don't think...

1359
01:47:49,111 --> 01:47:51,889
these conditions are gonna hold.
I think we should wait.

1360
01:47:51,989 --> 01:47:54,892
CASE is headed down
with the rest of the distillery equipment.

1361
01:47:54,992 --> 01:47:58,128
I'd really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

1362
01:47:59,746 --> 01:48:03,133
Well, these squalls do usually blow over.

1363
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:04,443
Okay, then.

1364
01:48:04,543 --> 01:48:06,820
- You'll need a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.

1365
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:08,763
- Are you charged?
- Yeah.

1366
01:48:09,047 --> 01:48:10,390
Follow me.

1367
01:48:10,882 --> 01:48:14,528
- TARS, 72 hours, yeah?
- Roger that, Cooper.

1368
01:48:20,726 --> 01:48:24,070
Brand told me why you feel
you have to go back.

1369
01:48:25,505 --> 01:48:28,592
But I'd be remiss
if I didn't at least mention...

1370
01:48:28,692 --> 01:48:32,963
that a mission such as ours
could certainly use an extra engineer.

1371
01:48:34,698 --> 01:48:39,052
You better slow down, turbo.
Safety first, CASE, remember.

1372
01:48:39,578 --> 01:48:41,630
Safety first, Cooper.

1373
01:48:42,581 --> 01:48:45,659
I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,
I'm honored to be a part of this.

1374
01:48:45,959 --> 01:48:51,265
But once we set up base camp and secure
those modules, my work's done here.

1375
01:48:51,381 --> 01:48:52,716
I'm going home.

1376
01:49:00,724 --> 01:49:03,884
You have attachments.
But even without a family...

1377
01:49:03,984 --> 01:49:09,407
I can promise you that that yearning
to be with other people is powerful.

1378
01:49:09,775 --> 01:49:13,411
That emotion is at the foundation...

1379
01:49:13,779 --> 01:49:16,923
of what makes us human.
It's not to be taken lightly.

1380
01:49:24,831 --> 01:49:27,517
- How long have you had that cough?
- A while.

1381
01:49:37,969 --> 01:49:40,188
Mom lets me play in here.

1382
01:49:41,607 --> 01:49:43,358
I don't touch your stuff.

1383
01:50:14,047 --> 01:50:15,974
Just take this gently.

1384
01:50:20,804 --> 01:50:24,482
You know why we couldn't just send machines
on these missions, don't you, Cooper?

1385
01:50:24,808 --> 01:50:29,537
A machine doesn't improvise well
because you can't program a fear of death.

1386
01:50:30,313 --> 01:50:34,632
Our survival instinct is our single
greatest source of inspiration.

1387
01:50:34,746 --> 01:50:36,661
Take you, for example.

1388
01:50:37,070 --> 01:50:38,705
A father...

1389
01:50:38,905 --> 01:50:42,208
with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

1390
01:50:43,076 --> 01:50:48,047
What does research tell us is the last thing
you're going to see before you die?

1391
01:50:49,457 --> 01:50:52,152
Your children. Their faces.

1392
01:50:52,252 --> 01:50:57,015
At the moment of death, your mind's
gonna push a little bit harder to survive.

1393
01:50:57,424 --> 01:50:58,966
For them.

1394
01:50:59,342 --> 01:51:00,894
Deep breath.

1395
01:51:02,888 --> 01:51:06,833
Hey. I bet you're Coop.
Why don't you have a seat here for me?

1396
01:51:06,933 --> 01:51:09,569
It's bad. They cannot stay here.

1397
01:51:09,978 --> 01:51:11,371
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1398
01:51:19,613 --> 01:51:21,139
TARS, what's taking so long?

1399
01:51:21,239 --> 01:51:24,184
Professor, I am having trouble
completing the boot up.

1400
01:51:24,284 --> 01:51:26,027
I don't understand.

1401
01:51:32,626 --> 01:51:34,177
It's funny.

1402
01:51:35,962 --> 01:51:37,889
When I left Earth...

1403
01:51:38,590 --> 01:51:40,975
I thought I was prepared to die.

1404
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:44,554
The truth is...

1405
01:51:46,264 --> 01:51:51,569
I never really considered the possibility
that my planet wasn't the one.

1406
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:56,383
Nothing worked out the way
it was supposed to.

1407
01:51:56,483 --> 01:51:58,025
Let's go.

1408
01:52:05,992 --> 01:52:08,887
All right, buddy,
give me a big deep breath.

1409
01:52:13,583 --> 01:52:15,101
What is this?

1410
01:52:15,418 --> 01:52:19,489
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry! I can't let you leave with that ship.

1411
01:52:19,589 --> 01:52:22,159
We're gonna need it
to complete the mission...

1412
01:52:22,259 --> 01:52:25,871
once the others realize
what this place isn't.

1413
01:52:25,971 --> 01:52:30,292
We cannot survive here.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1414
01:52:39,985 --> 01:52:43,180
- They can't stay here anymore.
- You have to leave right now.

1415
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:46,892
Let me make something abundantly clear.
You have a responsibility...

1416
01:52:46,992 --> 01:52:50,253
- Oh! Jesus!
- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.

1417
01:52:50,453 --> 01:52:52,439
Dad didn't raise you
to be this dumb, Tom!

1418
01:52:52,539 --> 01:52:56,726
Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did.
And he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.

1419
01:52:57,210 --> 01:53:00,179
You faked all the data?

1420
01:53:01,589 --> 01:53:02,974
Yeah.

1421
01:53:06,678 --> 01:53:08,455
There's no surface?

1422
01:53:08,555 --> 01:53:10,023
No.

1423
01:53:10,682 --> 01:53:12,751
I tried to do my duty, Cooper...

1424
01:53:12,851 --> 01:53:18,156
but I knew the day that I arrived here
that this place had nothing.

1425
01:53:18,481 --> 01:53:22,577
And I resisted
the temptation for years...

1426
01:53:22,902 --> 01:53:25,222
but I knew that...

1427
01:53:25,322 --> 01:53:28,350
if I just pressed that button, then...

1428
01:53:28,450 --> 01:53:30,552
somebody would come and save me.

1429
01:53:31,494 --> 01:53:33,096
You fucking coward.

1430
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:34,973
Yes.

1431
01:53:40,295 --> 01:53:41,638
Yes.

1432
01:53:43,256 --> 01:53:44,599
Yes.

1433
01:53:45,550 --> 01:53:46,660
Yes.

1434
01:53:58,104 --> 01:54:02,750
Listen, if you're not going to go,
let your family go. Just save your family.

1435
01:54:03,151 --> 01:54:07,597
And we go live underground with you?
Pray that Daddy comes to save us?

1436
01:54:07,697 --> 01:54:11,671
Dad's not coming back.
He never was coming back. It's up to me.

1437
01:54:11,771 --> 01:54:14,684
You're gonna save everybody?
Because Dad couldn't do it.

1438
01:54:14,784 --> 01:54:19,092
Dad didn't even try!
Dad just abandoned us!

1439
01:54:19,542 --> 01:54:21,636
He left us here to die.

1440
01:54:22,045 --> 01:54:23,813
Nobody's going with you.

1441
01:54:27,425 --> 01:54:30,436
You gonna wait for your next kid to die?

1442
01:54:33,139 --> 01:54:34,732
Get out.

1443
01:54:35,308 --> 01:54:36,943
And don't come back.

1444
01:54:41,523 --> 01:54:43,658
You can keep my stuff.

1445
01:54:54,285 --> 01:54:55,962
Stop it!

1446
01:54:58,665 --> 01:55:00,550
No. No!

1447
01:55:01,334 --> 01:55:04,512
Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance
you're gonna kill yourself!

1448
01:55:05,046 --> 01:55:07,115
Those are the best odds
I've had in years.

1449
01:55:27,485 --> 01:55:29,620
Don't judge me, Cooper.

1450
01:55:30,071 --> 01:55:34,409
You were never tested like I was.
Few men have been.

1451
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:44,218
You tried your best, Murph.

1452
01:55:53,428 --> 01:55:55,726
You're feeling it, aren't you?

1453
01:55:56,473 --> 01:55:58,608
The survival instinct.

1454
01:55:59,225 --> 01:56:03,663
That's what drove me. It's what drives
all of us. And it's what's gonna save us.

1455
01:56:04,731 --> 01:56:08,367
Because I want to save all of us.
For you, Cooper.

1456
01:56:13,239 --> 01:56:17,018
I'm sorry, I can't watch you
go through this. I'm sorry.

1457
01:56:17,118 --> 01:56:20,087
I thought I could, but I can't.

1458
01:56:20,872 --> 01:56:23,233
I'm here. I'm here for you.

1459
01:56:23,333 --> 01:56:25,676
Just listen to my voice, Cooper.

1460
01:56:26,169 --> 01:56:28,004
I'm right here.

1461
01:56:29,339 --> 01:56:30,973
You're not alone.

1462
01:56:40,391 --> 01:56:42,093
Do you see your children?

1463
01:56:45,146 --> 01:56:46,781
It's okay.

1464
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:49,492
They're right there with you.

1465
01:56:53,071 --> 01:56:55,957
Did Professor Brand tell you
that poem before you left?

1466
01:56:56,491 --> 01:56:58,292
Do you remember?

1467
01:57:00,370 --> 01:57:03,639
Do not go gentle into that good night

1468
01:57:04,958 --> 01:57:09,804
Old age should burn and rave
At close of day

1469
01:57:11,089 --> 01:57:13,766
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light

1470
01:57:38,116 --> 01:57:39,851
Brand! Help!

1471
01:57:39,951 --> 01:57:42,211
- Help!
- Cooper?

1472
01:57:48,626 --> 01:57:50,111
CASE!

1473
01:57:50,211 --> 01:57:51,804
No air.

1474
01:57:52,338 --> 01:57:53,848
Ammonia.

1475
01:57:54,632 --> 01:57:57,202
Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!

1476
01:57:57,302 --> 01:57:59,287
- I have a fix.
- Go! Go, go, go!

1477
01:57:59,387 --> 01:58:01,772
And away!

1478
01:58:13,026 --> 01:58:15,303
Cooper, we're coming.
Hang in there. Don't talk.

1479
01:58:15,403 --> 01:58:17,997
Try to breathe as little as possible.
We're almost there.

1480
01:58:21,467 --> 01:58:27,089
There's a security lockout, sir.
It requires a person to access function.

1481
01:58:31,836 --> 01:58:33,638
It's all yours, sir.

1482
01:58:41,654 --> 01:58:43,414
Try not to breathe.

1483
01:58:44,015 --> 01:58:48,044
We're coming. We're coming right now.
CASE, come on! Come on!

1484
01:58:48,144 --> 01:58:51,155
We got to go faster, CASE!
Faster, faster, faster!

1485
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:57,370
Hang in there. Come on.

1486
01:59:03,576 --> 01:59:07,171
I see him, I see him!
CASE, bank! Bank right!

1487
01:59:25,890 --> 01:59:28,993
Cooper! Cooper! I'm here!

1488
01:59:52,125 --> 01:59:54,327
This data makes no sense.

1489
02:00:02,552 --> 02:00:04,037
I'm sorry.

1490
02:00:04,137 --> 02:00:07,023
- What?
- Mann was lying!

1491
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:16,574
Go. Go.

1492
02:00:17,358 --> 02:00:18,676
Romilly.

1493
02:00:18,776 --> 02:00:20,053
Romilly!

1494
02:00:20,153 --> 02:00:22,872
Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?

1495
02:00:23,156 --> 02:00:25,258
Step back, professor! Step back!

1496
02:00:33,082 --> 02:00:35,968
- Romilly...
- Romilly, do you read me?

1497
02:00:38,671 --> 02:00:40,506
Keep watch!

1498
02:00:41,174 --> 02:00:42,400
Lois?

1499
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:45,603
- What happened to caution, CASE?
- Safety first, Cooper.

1500
02:00:46,679 --> 02:00:50,399
Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?
This is Brand.

1501
02:00:52,977 --> 02:00:54,087
Romilly?

1502
02:00:54,187 --> 02:00:57,073
Dr. Brand. Cooper.
There's been an explosion.

1503
02:00:57,398 --> 02:00:59,492
Dr. Mann's compound.

1504
02:01:26,803 --> 02:01:29,146
TARS, TARS, 10 o'clock!

1505
02:01:35,228 --> 02:01:37,488
Let me know when TARS is aboard.

1506
02:01:40,817 --> 02:01:42,993
Romilly did not survive.

1507
02:01:43,903 --> 02:01:45,638
I could not save him.

1508
02:01:45,738 --> 02:01:47,265
- TARS is in.
- I'll take her now.

1509
02:01:47,365 --> 02:01:50,309
- Do we have a fix on the Ranger?
- He's pushing into orbit!

1510
02:01:50,409 --> 02:01:53,712
If he takes control
of that ship, we're dead.

1511
02:01:54,622 --> 02:01:57,883
- He'd maroon us?
- He is marooning us.

1512
02:01:59,585 --> 02:02:02,388
I'll meet you guys downstairs.
Go wait by the car.

1513
02:02:09,929 --> 02:02:14,441
Come on! Give me your bag.
Get in the backseat. Get in the backseat now!

1514
02:02:19,772 --> 02:02:21,991
Dr. Mann, please respond.

1515
02:02:22,316 --> 02:02:24,469
Dr. Mann, please respond!

1516
02:02:24,769 --> 02:02:26,846
He doesn't know
the Endurance docking procedure.

1517
02:02:26,946 --> 02:02:29,748
- The autopilot does.
- Not since TARS disabled it.

1518
02:02:30,658 --> 02:02:31,768
Nice.

1519
02:02:31,868 --> 02:02:35,087
- What's your trust setting, TARS?
- Lower than yours apparently.

1520
02:02:38,416 --> 02:02:42,028
Do not attempt docking.
I repeat, do not attempt docking.

1521
02:02:42,128 --> 02:02:43,237
Please res...

1522
02:03:42,605 --> 02:03:45,049
Auto-docking sequence withheld.

1523
02:03:45,149 --> 02:03:48,118
- Override.
- Unauthorized.

1524
02:03:48,527 --> 02:03:50,162
Override.

1525
02:03:50,363 --> 02:03:52,539
Unauthorized.

1526
02:03:56,369 --> 02:04:00,598
Do not attempt docking. I repeat,
do not attempt docking. Please resp...

1527
02:04:44,291 --> 02:04:46,560
Moving slowly toward the Endurance.

1528
02:05:10,985 --> 02:05:12,637
Imperfect contact.

1529
02:05:12,737 --> 02:05:15,080
- Override.
- Hatch lockout.

1530
02:05:22,580 --> 02:05:25,424
- Is he locked on yet?
- Imperfectly.

1531
02:05:26,959 --> 02:05:28,277
Dr. Mann, do not...

1532
02:05:49,690 --> 02:05:52,993
Hatch lockout disengaged.

1533
02:06:01,243 --> 02:06:04,981
Dr. Mann, do not,
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1534
02:06:05,081 --> 02:06:07,024
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1535
02:06:07,124 --> 02:06:10,260
If you open the hatch,
the airlock will depressurize.

1536
02:06:35,861 --> 02:06:38,455
- What happens if he blows the airlock?
- Nothing good.

1537
02:06:44,036 --> 02:06:46,731
Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters,
everything we've got, CASE!

1538
02:06:46,831 --> 02:06:48,607
- Thrusters are full!
- Back!

1539
02:06:48,707 --> 02:06:50,776
Relay my transmission
to the onboard computer...

1540
02:06:50,876 --> 02:06:53,029
and have it rebroadcast
as emergency P.A.

1541
02:06:53,129 --> 02:06:54,471
Dr. Mann...

1542
02:06:56,757 --> 02:06:59,702
I repeat, do not open
the inner hatch. I repeat...

1543
02:06:59,802 --> 02:07:01,145
Brand?

1544
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:03,789
I don't know what he said to you...

1545
02:07:03,889 --> 02:07:06,859
but I am taking command
of the Endurance.

1546
02:07:07,017 --> 02:07:09,361
And then we can talk
about completing the mission.

1547
02:07:12,523 --> 02:07:14,333
Dr. Mann, listen to me.

1548
02:07:15,025 --> 02:07:17,327
This is not about my life.

1549
02:07:17,653 --> 02:07:21,206
Or Cooper's life.
This is about all mankind.

1550
02:07:21,490 --> 02:07:23,108
There is a moment...

1551
02:07:29,248 --> 02:07:30,683
It is not sa...

1552
02:07:38,883 --> 02:07:40,025
Oh, my God.

1553
02:07:58,235 --> 02:08:02,498
- There's no point using fuel to chase...
- Analyze the Endurance's spin.

1554
02:08:07,453 --> 02:08:09,963
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Docking.

1555
02:08:14,251 --> 02:08:17,154
Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.

1556
02:08:17,254 --> 02:08:19,782
Okay, get ready to match our spin
with the retro thrusters.

1557
02:08:19,882 --> 02:08:23,402
- It's not possible.
- No... it's necessary.

1558
02:08:34,939 --> 02:08:37,407
Endurance is hitting stratosphere!

1559
02:08:41,153 --> 02:08:43,497
She's got no heat shield.

1560
02:08:46,325 --> 02:08:48,177
- CASE, you ready?
- Ready.

1561
02:08:56,502 --> 02:08:59,972
Cooper! This is no time for caution.

1562
02:09:01,215 --> 02:09:03,742
CASE, if I black out,
you take the stick.

1563
02:09:03,842 --> 02:09:06,603
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

1564
02:09:13,352 --> 02:09:16,422
- Endurance is starting to heat.
- Twenty feet out.

1565
02:09:16,522 --> 02:09:19,091
I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.

1566
02:09:19,191 --> 02:09:21,260
Ten feet out.

1567
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:23,929
Cooper, we are lined up.

1568
02:09:24,029 --> 02:09:25,714
Initiating spin!

1569
02:10:07,197 --> 02:10:08,507
Come on, TARS.

1570
02:10:16,665 --> 02:10:18,308
Come on, TARS!

1571
02:10:29,428 --> 02:10:32,147
- We are locked, Cooper.
- Locked. Easing up!

1572
02:10:39,730 --> 02:10:41,365
Easy.

1573
02:10:42,232 --> 02:10:43,867
Easy.

1574
02:10:49,406 --> 02:10:50,808
Retro thrusters!

1575
02:10:58,874 --> 02:11:00,676
Main engines on.

1576
02:11:06,131 --> 02:11:09,042
Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.

1577
02:11:16,850 --> 02:11:18,819
Killing main engines!

1578
02:11:19,770 --> 02:11:21,738
Okay, we're out of orbit.

1579
02:11:28,779 --> 02:11:31,857
Okay. And for our next trick!

1580
02:11:33,492 --> 02:11:37,629
It'll have to be good.
We're heading into Gargantua's pull.

1581
02:11:38,247 --> 02:11:39,389
Oh, shit.

1582
02:11:39,790 --> 02:11:41,683
- CASE, take the stick.
- Roger that.

1583
02:12:31,550 --> 02:12:33,986
Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.

1584
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:37,247
Shall I use main engines?

1585
02:12:37,347 --> 02:12:41,526
No. We got to let her slide
as far as we can.

1586
02:12:50,027 --> 02:12:52,971
- Give it to me.
- There's good news, there's bad news.

1587
02:12:53,071 --> 02:12:56,800
Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.
Give it to me straight.

1588
02:13:05,542 --> 02:13:08,821
The backup generator kicked in,
so the system's stable. They're all good.

1589
02:13:08,921 --> 02:13:10,263
Good.

1590
02:13:10,380 --> 02:13:13,784
Okay. The navigational hub
has been completely destroyed.

1591
02:13:13,884 --> 02:13:16,912
We don't have enough life support
to make it back to Earth, but...

1592
02:13:17,012 --> 02:13:19,164
I think we can scratch our way
to Edmunds' planet.

1593
02:13:19,264 --> 02:13:23,619
- What about fuel?
- Not enough. But I have a plan.

1594
02:13:24,144 --> 02:13:28,548
We let Gargantua pull us down
close to her horizon.

1595
02:13:28,649 --> 02:13:31,969
Then a powered slingshot around,
launching us towards Edmunds' planet.

1596
02:13:32,069 --> 02:13:34,638
- Manually?
- That's what I'm here for.

1597
02:13:34,738 --> 02:13:37,316
I'm gonna take us
just inside the critical orbit.

1598
02:13:37,416 --> 02:13:40,185
- What about time slippage?
- Neither of us has time to worry...

1599
02:13:40,285 --> 02:13:42,255
about relativity right now, Dr. Brand.

1600
02:13:46,583 --> 02:13:48,185
I'm sorry, Cooper.

1601
02:13:51,213 --> 02:13:54,700
Once we've gathered
enough speed around Gargantua...

1602
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:56,935
we use Lander 1...

1603
02:13:57,135 --> 02:13:59,729
and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...

1604
02:14:00,297 --> 02:14:03,099
push us out of the black hole's gravity.

1605
02:14:04,935 --> 02:14:07,671
The Lender's linkages
have been destroyed...

1606
02:14:07,771 --> 02:14:10,407
so we'll have to control manually.

1607
02:14:11,316 --> 02:14:14,645
Once Lander 1 is spent,
TARS will detach...

1608
02:14:14,745 --> 02:14:16,855
And get sucked into that black hole.

1609
02:14:17,281 --> 02:14:18,908
Why does TARS have to detach?

1610
02:14:19,008 --> 02:14:21,518
We have to shed the weight
to escape the gravity.

1611
02:14:21,618 --> 02:14:23,061
Newton's third law.

1612
02:14:23,161 --> 02:14:25,939
The only way humans have ever
figured out of getting somewhere...

1613
02:14:26,039 --> 02:14:27,649
is to leave something behind.

1614
02:14:27,749 --> 02:14:30,860
Cooper, you can't ask TARS
to do this for us.

1615
02:14:30,961 --> 02:14:34,865
He's a robot. So you don't have
to ask him to do anything.

1616
02:14:34,965 --> 02:14:38,685
- Cooper, you asshole!
- Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.

1617
02:14:38,885 --> 02:14:41,371
It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.

1618
02:14:41,471 --> 02:14:43,999
It's our only chance
to save people on Earth.

1619
02:14:44,099 --> 02:14:47,377
If I can find a way to transmit
the quantum data I'll find in there...

1620
02:14:47,477 --> 02:14:49,613
they might still make it.

1621
02:14:50,556 --> 02:14:53,483
Let's just hope
there's still someone there to save.

1622
02:15:21,470 --> 02:15:23,438
Maximum velocity achieved.

1623
02:15:24,389 --> 02:15:26,959
Prepare to fire escape thrusters.

1624
02:15:27,359 --> 02:15:29,795
- Ready?
- Ready.

1625
02:15:29,895 --> 02:15:33,090
- Ready.
- Main engine ignition in three...

1626
02:15:33,190 --> 02:15:34,658
two...

1627
02:15:34,983 --> 02:15:36,918
one. Mark.

1628
02:15:50,248 --> 02:15:51,800
Come on, baby.

1629
02:15:52,668 --> 02:15:55,070
Lander 1 engines, on my mark.

1630
02:15:55,624 --> 02:15:57,823
Three, two...

1631
02:15:57,923 --> 02:15:59,724
one. Mark.

1632
02:16:04,763 --> 02:16:07,416
Ranger 2 engines, on my mark.

1633
02:16:07,516 --> 02:16:10,193
Three, two, one...

1634
02:16:10,435 --> 02:16:11,903
- Mark.
- Fire!

1635
02:16:21,738 --> 02:16:25,208
This little maneuver's
gonna cost us 51 years!

1636
02:16:25,784 --> 02:16:28,586
You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!

1637
02:16:43,677 --> 02:16:47,147
Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.

1638
02:16:47,514 --> 02:16:50,216
Three, two...

1639
02:16:51,043 --> 02:16:54,079
- one. Mark.
- Detach!

1640
02:16:57,149 --> 02:16:59,718
- Goodbye, TARS.
- Goodbye, Dr. Brand.

1641
02:16:59,818 --> 02:17:02,921
- See you on the other side, Coop.
- See you there, Slick!

1642
02:17:11,329 --> 02:17:13,214
Okay, CASE.

1643
02:17:13,657 --> 02:17:17,635
- Nice reckless flying!
- Learned from the master.

1644
02:17:17,794 --> 02:17:20,447
- Ranger 2, prepare to detach.
- What?

1645
02:17:20,547 --> 02:17:23,767
No! No! Cooper! What are you doing?

1646
02:17:23,925 --> 02:17:27,704
Newton's third law.
You got to leave something behind.

1647
02:17:27,804 --> 02:17:30,290
You told me we had enough resources
for both of us.

1648
02:17:30,390 --> 02:17:32,417
We agreed, Amelia...

1649
02:17:32,517 --> 02:17:34,277
90 percent.

1650
02:17:35,854 --> 02:17:37,238
Don't.

1651
02:17:39,149 --> 02:17:40,617
Detach.

1652
02:17:53,413 --> 02:17:56,566
Okay, I am nosing down.

1653
02:17:59,961 --> 02:18:02,263
Approaching the event horizon.

1654
02:18:04,216 --> 02:18:09,020
Portside, dipping down beneath it
to go through it.

1655
02:18:10,305 --> 02:18:13,375
Heading towards blackness.

1656
02:18:13,475 --> 02:18:15,777
I have a visual of the event.

1657
02:18:15,977 --> 02:18:17,654
It's all black.

1658
02:18:19,681 --> 02:18:23,284
TARS, do you read me? It's all blackness.

1659
02:18:24,986 --> 02:18:27,788
TARS! Do you read me? Over.

1660
02:18:31,827 --> 02:18:33,294
Okay.

1661
02:18:34,204 --> 02:18:35,755
Screens...

1662
02:18:37,082 --> 02:18:38,883
getting interference.

1663
02:18:40,293 --> 02:18:43,179
Losing control of the stick.
I got flashes.

1664
02:18:43,463 --> 02:18:45,932
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

1665
02:18:46,842 --> 02:18:49,644
The turbulence in the gravity
is increasing.

1666
02:18:56,017 --> 02:18:58,227
The computers are going down. Agh.

1667
02:19:09,948 --> 02:19:13,084
Gravitational pull.
I'm losing control of the stick.

1668
02:19:46,151 --> 02:19:47,919
Murph? Murph, come on!

1669
02:19:53,491 --> 02:19:55,793
Eject. Eject.

1670
02:19:56,995 --> 02:19:58,379
Eject.

1671
02:19:58,496 --> 02:19:59,964
Eject.

1672
02:20:00,206 --> 02:20:01,549
Eject.

1673
02:20:01,958 --> 02:20:03,343
Eject.

1674
02:21:55,238 --> 02:21:56,581
Murph.

1675
02:22:06,249 --> 02:22:08,518
Murph! Murph! Murph!

1676
02:22:16,801 --> 02:22:18,144
Murph.

1677
02:22:25,060 --> 02:22:27,045
No, no, no!

1678
02:22:27,145 --> 02:22:28,505
Murph!

1679
02:22:28,605 --> 02:22:31,416
Murph! No! No!

1680
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,061
If you're leaving, just go.

1681
02:23:33,461 --> 02:23:34,729
No, no. No.

1682
02:23:36,214 --> 02:23:38,616
No, don't go. Don't go, you idiot.

1683
02:23:38,716 --> 02:23:40,309
Don't go!

1684
02:23:41,970 --> 02:23:43,938
Morse. Morse.

1685
02:23:44,389 --> 02:23:45,731
Morse.

1686
02:23:46,441 --> 02:23:48,501
Dot. Dot.

1687
02:23:48,601 --> 02:23:49,944
S.

1688
02:23:55,775 --> 02:23:57,118
T.

1689
02:24:01,406 --> 02:24:02,557
A.

1690
02:24:02,657 --> 02:24:03,941
Dash!

1691
02:24:06,536 --> 02:24:08,171
Dash! Dash!

1692
02:24:08,371 --> 02:24:09,481
Murph!

1693
02:24:09,581 --> 02:24:11,883
Murph, we don't have time for this!
Come on!

1694
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,626
Y.

1695
02:24:18,623 --> 02:24:19,765
"Stay!"

1696
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:33,196
Come on. Come on, Murph. Come on!

1697
02:24:33,563 --> 02:24:35,656
What's it say? What's it say, Murph?

1698
02:24:36,149 --> 02:24:37,733
What's it say?

1699
02:24:47,785 --> 02:24:49,212
"Stay."

1700
02:25:24,656 --> 02:25:27,792
Tell him, Murph. Make him stay.

1701
02:25:31,211 --> 02:25:32,797
Make him stay, Murph.

1702
02:25:41,506 --> 02:25:43,683
Make him stay, Murph.

1703
02:25:44,842 --> 02:25:47,270
Don't let me leave, Murph!

1704
02:25:50,181 --> 02:25:52,900
Don't let me leave, Murph!

1705
02:25:58,498 --> 02:26:01,333
No! No! No!

1706
02:26:21,721 --> 02:26:23,522
It was you.

1707
02:26:34,392 --> 02:26:36,736
You were my ghost.

1708
02:26:46,154 --> 02:26:49,757
Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.

1709
02:26:50,950 --> 02:26:53,753
- TARS?
- Roger that.

1710
02:26:55,246 --> 02:26:58,174
- You survived.
- Somewhere...

1711
02:26:58,416 --> 02:27:00,526
in their fifth dimension.

1712
02:27:00,626 --> 02:27:03,029
They saved us.

1713
02:27:03,129 --> 02:27:08,409
Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?
And just why would they want to help us?

1714
02:27:08,509 --> 02:27:11,287
I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

1715
02:27:11,387 --> 02:27:14,749
inside their five-dimensional reality
to allow you to understand it.

1716
02:27:14,849 --> 02:27:16,876
Yeah, that ain't working.

1717
02:27:16,976 --> 02:27:18,586
Yes, it is.

1718
02:27:18,686 --> 02:27:22,632
You've seen that time is represented here
as a physical dimension.

1719
02:27:22,732 --> 02:27:25,868
You have worked out that you can exert
a force across space-time.

1720
02:27:26,235 --> 02:27:29,681
Gravity to send a message.

1721
02:27:29,981 --> 02:27:31,615
Affirmative.

1722
02:27:33,701 --> 02:27:35,327
Gravity...

1723
02:27:35,953 --> 02:27:39,524
can cross the dimensions, including time.

1724
02:27:39,624 --> 02:27:41,217
Apparently.

1725
02:27:44,796 --> 02:27:47,098
Do you have the quantum data?

1726
02:27:47,215 --> 02:27:49,141
Roger. I have it.

1727
02:27:49,801 --> 02:27:53,871
I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,
but nothing is getting out, Cooper.

1728
02:27:53,971 --> 02:27:56,524
I can do this. I can do this.

1729
02:27:56,682 --> 02:27:59,502
But such complicated data to a child?

1730
02:27:59,602 --> 02:28:00,795
Not just any child.

1731
02:28:00,895 --> 02:28:05,282
What else? Oh, come on, Dad.

1732
02:28:07,151 --> 02:28:09,387
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

1733
02:28:09,487 --> 02:28:13,791
Even if you communicate it here,
she won't understand its significance for years.

1734
02:28:14,283 --> 02:28:15,810
I get that, TARS.

1735
02:28:15,910 --> 02:28:20,648
But we've got to figure something out
or the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!

1736
02:28:20,748 --> 02:28:22,400
Cooper...

1737
02:28:22,500 --> 02:28:25,302
they didn't bring us here
to change the past.

1738
02:28:28,589 --> 02:28:30,158
Say that again.

1739
02:28:30,258 --> 02:28:34,019
They didn't bring us here
to change the past.

1740
02:28:38,141 --> 02:28:40,401
No, they didn't bring us here at all.

1741
02:28:44,730 --> 02:28:46,899
We brought ourselves.

1742
02:28:55,658 --> 02:29:00,004
TARS, give me the coordinates
for NASA in binary.

1743
02:29:00,246 --> 02:29:03,007
In binary. Roger. Feeding data.

1744
02:29:27,023 --> 02:29:29,441
"It's not a ghost."

1745
02:29:30,693 --> 02:29:32,428
"It's gravity."

1746
02:29:32,528 --> 02:29:34,497
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

1747
02:29:34,864 --> 02:29:36,957
I brought myself here!

1748
02:29:37,533 --> 02:29:41,337
We're here to communicate
with the three-dimensional world.

1749
02:29:41,454 --> 02:29:43,255
We're the bridge!

1750
02:29:50,963 --> 02:29:53,057
I thought they chose me.

1751
02:29:56,093 --> 02:30:00,064
- But they didn't choose me, they chose her.
- For what, Cooper?

1752
02:30:02,266 --> 02:30:04,235
To save the world.

1753
02:30:08,231 --> 02:30:12,844
All of this is one little girl's bedroom.
Every moment.

1754
02:30:12,944 --> 02:30:14,429
It's infinitely complex.

1755
02:30:14,529 --> 02:30:19,350
They have access to infinite time and space,
but they're not bound by anything!

1756
02:30:19,450 --> 02:30:24,421
They can't find a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

1757
02:30:25,623 --> 02:30:28,693
That's why I'm here.
I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...

1758
02:30:28,793 --> 02:30:30,361
just like I found this moment.

1759
02:30:30,461 --> 02:30:32,864
- How, Cooper?
- Love, TARS, love.

1760
02:30:32,964 --> 02:30:37,452
It's just like Brand said. My connection
with Murph, it is quantifiable. It's the key!

1761
02:30:37,552 --> 02:30:39,728
What are we here to do?

1762
02:30:40,346 --> 02:30:42,523
Find how to tell her.

1763
02:30:45,017 --> 02:30:46,652
The watch.

1764
02:30:49,480 --> 02:30:50,948
The watch.

1765
02:30:52,024 --> 02:30:53,450
That's it.

1766
02:30:55,653 --> 02:30:58,956
We code the data into the movement
of the second hand.

1767
02:31:02,285 --> 02:31:05,563
TARS, translate the data into Morse
and feed it to me.

1768
02:31:05,663 --> 02:31:10,259
Translating data to Morse.
Cooper, what if she never came back for it?

1769
02:31:11,627 --> 02:31:14,597
She will. She will.

1770
02:31:15,506 --> 02:31:17,433
Murph, I can see his car!

1771
02:31:18,342 --> 02:31:19,610
He's coming, Murph!

1772
02:31:21,345 --> 02:31:23,480
Okay. I'm coming down.

1773
02:31:24,640 --> 02:31:26,442
How do you know?

1774
02:31:29,353 --> 02:31:31,488
Because I gave it to her.

1775
02:31:36,569 --> 02:31:39,371
Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.

1776
02:31:42,575 --> 02:31:44,002
Dot-dot...

1777
02:31:45,036 --> 02:31:47,004
dash-dot.

1778
02:31:47,163 --> 02:31:49,106
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

1779
02:31:49,206 --> 02:31:52,176
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

1780
02:31:52,376 --> 02:31:53,945
Dash-dash-dash.

1781
02:31:54,045 --> 02:31:56,597
Dash, dash, dash.

1782
02:32:14,565 --> 02:32:16,400
He came back!

1783
02:32:16,817 --> 02:32:21,288
It was him all the time!
I didn't know. It was him!

1784
02:32:22,073 --> 02:32:24,333
Dad's gonna save us.

1785
02:33:06,784 --> 02:33:08,135
Eureka!

1786
02:33:11,789 --> 02:33:13,424
It's traditional.

1787
02:33:17,712 --> 02:33:19,638
Eureka!

1788
02:33:24,051 --> 02:33:25,620
Did it work?

1789
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:27,855
I think it might have.

1790
02:33:28,931 --> 02:33:30,291
How do you know?

1791
02:33:30,391 --> 02:33:34,069
Because the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract.

1792
02:33:37,606 --> 02:33:39,908
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

1793
02:33:40,776 --> 02:33:42,911
They're not "beings."

1794
02:33:43,279 --> 02:33:44,913
They're us.

1795
02:33:46,657 --> 02:33:50,085
What I've been doing for Murph,
they're doing for me.

1796
02:33:50,327 --> 02:33:51,896
For all of us.

1797
02:33:51,996 --> 02:33:54,315
Cooper, people couldn't build this.

1798
02:33:54,415 --> 02:33:57,068
No. No, not yet.

1799
02:33:57,168 --> 02:33:58,927
But one day.

1800
02:33:59,295 --> 02:34:02,806
Not you and me. But people.

1801
02:34:03,174 --> 02:34:07,519
A civilization that's evolved past
the four dimensions we know.

1802
02:34:13,809 --> 02:34:15,611
What happens now?

1803
02:35:17,915 --> 02:35:19,675
Mr. Cooper.

1804
02:35:23,587 --> 02:35:25,597
All right. Let's take it slow, sir.

1805
02:35:25,714 --> 02:35:27,908
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.

1806
02:35:28,008 --> 02:35:33,355
Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.
Actually, you are 124 years old.

1807
02:35:40,062 --> 02:35:41,697
Take it slow, sir.

1808
02:35:42,314 --> 02:35:44,842
You were... extremely lucky.

1809
02:35:44,942 --> 02:35:48,579
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

1810
02:36:02,459 --> 02:36:04,094
Where am I?

1811
02:36:05,462 --> 02:36:07,306
Cooper Station.

1812
02:36:08,424 --> 02:36:10,267
Currently orbiting Saturn.

1813
02:36:11,969 --> 02:36:14,313
Cooper Station.

1814
02:36:16,473 --> 02:36:18,542
Nice of you to name it after me.

1815
02:36:22,313 --> 02:36:23,464
What?

1816
02:36:23,564 --> 02:36:26,975
The station isn't named after you, sir.
It's... named after your daughter.

1817
02:36:27,276 --> 02:36:30,346
Although she's always maintained
just how important you were.

1818
02:36:30,446 --> 02:36:32,456
Is she still alive?

1819
02:36:34,116 --> 02:36:36,294
She'll be here in a couple weeks.

1820
02:36:37,036 --> 02:36:39,563
She is far too old to be transferring
from another station...

1821
02:36:39,663 --> 02:36:42,341
but when she heard
that you'd been found...

1822
02:36:43,250 --> 02:36:46,061
well, this is... Murphy Cooper
we're talking about.

1823
02:36:46,837 --> 02:36:48,639
Yes, it is.

1824
02:36:50,466 --> 02:36:53,268
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple days.

1825
02:36:55,638 --> 02:36:58,440
I'm sure you'll be excited to see
what's in store.

1826
02:36:59,391 --> 02:37:03,587
I actually... did a paper on you
in high school.

1827
02:37:03,687 --> 02:37:06,323
I know all about your life
back on Earth.

1828
02:37:07,691 --> 02:37:08,926
Oh, yeah.

1829
02:37:09,026 --> 02:37:10,577
Right.

1830
02:37:12,696 --> 02:37:18,335
If... If you'll follow me,
we've got a really good situation for you.

1831
02:37:21,372 --> 02:37:25,717
So... when I made my suggestion
to Miss Cooper...

1832
02:37:26,335 --> 02:37:29,629
I was delighted to hear
that she thought it was perfect.

1833
02:37:32,508 --> 02:37:35,870
It was just constant.
Just that steady blow of dirt.

1834
02:37:35,970 --> 02:37:38,956
Of course,
I didn't speak to her personally.

1835
02:37:39,056 --> 02:37:41,125
We always set the plate upside-down.

1836
02:37:41,225 --> 02:37:44,044
Glasses or cups,
whatever it was, upside-down.

1837
02:37:44,144 --> 02:37:49,133
Well, my dad was a farmer.
Like everybody else back then.

1838
02:37:49,233 --> 02:37:51,760
There just wasn't enough food.

1839
02:37:51,860 --> 02:37:54,638
We wore little things, little strips...

1840
02:37:54,738 --> 02:37:59,977
of sheet over our nose and mouth
so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

1841
02:38:00,077 --> 02:38:03,606
Well, it was pretty exciting for me
because it was hope.

1842
02:38:03,706 --> 02:38:07,985
I don't care who describes it, there is
no way for it to be exaggerated.

1843
02:38:08,085 --> 02:38:11,989
She did confirm
just how much you loved farming.

1844
02:38:12,089 --> 02:38:15,434
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah. Come here.

1845
02:38:15,718 --> 02:38:20,748
Home sweet home.
Everything replaced and put back where it...

1846
02:38:27,062 --> 02:38:29,173
- Hey, is this...?
- Oh, yeah.

1847
02:38:29,273 --> 02:38:32,343
The machine we found out near Saturn
when we found you. Yes.

1848
02:38:32,443 --> 02:38:35,179
Its... power source was shot,
but we could get you another one.

1849
02:38:35,279 --> 02:38:37,748
Yes. Please.

1850
02:38:38,657 --> 02:38:40,292
Settings.

1851
02:38:40,451 --> 02:38:42,252
General settings.

1852
02:38:42,453 --> 02:38:44,588
Security settings.

1853
02:38:46,999 --> 02:38:49,593
Honesty, new setting:

1854
02:38:50,461 --> 02:38:52,321
95 percent.

1855
02:38:52,421 --> 02:38:55,223
Confirmed. Additional customization?

1856
02:38:55,799 --> 02:38:57,225
Humor:

1857
02:38:58,427 --> 02:39:00,204
75 percent.

1858
02:39:00,304 --> 02:39:01,938
Confirmed.

1859
02:39:02,306 --> 02:39:05,501
Auto self-destruct T-minus 10, nine...

1860
02:39:05,601 --> 02:39:07,819
Let's make that 60 percent.

1861
02:39:09,813 --> 02:39:12,241
Sixty percent confirmed.

1862
02:39:12,566 --> 02:39:15,952
- Knock-knock.
- You want 55?

1863
02:39:20,532 --> 02:39:22,959
Is this really what it was like?

1864
02:39:24,870 --> 02:39:27,589
It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.

1865
02:39:31,794 --> 02:39:35,764
I don't care much for this pretending
we're back where we started.

1866
02:39:37,549 --> 02:39:40,143
I want to know where we are.

1867
02:39:41,470 --> 02:39:43,313
Where we're going.

1868
02:39:47,559 --> 02:39:50,713
- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.
- Yeah.

1869
02:39:50,813 --> 02:39:51,964
Family?

1870
02:39:52,064 --> 02:39:56,143
Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's
been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

1871
02:40:29,017 --> 02:40:31,600
You told them I like farming.

1872
02:40:36,859 --> 02:40:39,027
It was me, Murph.

1873
02:40:40,988 --> 02:40:43,081
I was your ghost.

1874
02:40:44,074 --> 02:40:46,001
I know.

1875
02:40:47,494 --> 02:40:52,274
People didn't believe me.
They thought that I was doing it all myself.

1876
02:40:52,374 --> 02:40:53,717
But...

1877
02:40:56,295 --> 02:40:58,755
I knew who it was.

1878
02:41:03,218 --> 02:41:05,687
Nobody believed me.

1879
02:41:05,888 --> 02:41:08,507
But I knew you'd come back.

1880
02:41:10,893 --> 02:41:12,402
How?

1881
02:41:14,104 --> 02:41:17,532
Because my dad promised me.

1882
02:41:23,280 --> 02:41:25,582
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

1883
02:41:26,475 --> 02:41:28,410
I'm here.

1884
02:41:29,369 --> 02:41:30,904
No.

1885
02:41:32,789 --> 02:41:37,219
No parent should have to watch
their own child die.

1886
02:41:39,838 --> 02:41:43,007
I have my kids here for me now.

1887
02:41:45,002 --> 02:41:47,103
You go.

1888
02:41:49,723 --> 02:41:51,525
Where?

1889
02:41:54,728 --> 02:41:56,613
Brand.

1890
02:42:05,956 --> 02:42:08,283
She's out there...

1891
02:42:13,806 --> 02:42:16,258
setting up camp.

1892
02:42:42,442 --> 02:42:44,452
Alone...

1893
02:42:45,320 --> 02:42:48,290
in a strange galaxy.

1894
02:42:58,875 --> 02:43:03,847
Maybe right now
she's settling in for the long nap...

1895
02:43:21,898 --> 02:43:25,035
by the light of our new sun...

1896
02:43:40,208 --> 02:43:42,552
in our new home.

1897
02:43:42,752 --> 02:43:47,752
